We used camera traps to study habitat use and spatio-temporal interactions among three large carnivores—tiger, leopard, and dhole—in two national parks in Thailand where key prey species (sambar, gaur) were scarce from overhunting. The availability of remnant sambar was the strongest determinant of tiger occupancy. Leopard occupancy was positively related to the presence of wild pig. Dhole occupancy was negatively associated with sambar, opposite to tiger. Results of two-species occupancy modeling did not support our hypothesis that leopard would be excluded from tiger-occupied zones, but leopard detectability was seven times lower in the presence of tigers, indicative of fine-scale avoidance. Dhole avoidance of sambar might have been a tactic by which dhole avoided tigers. All three carnivores were mainly diurnal and thus had high temporal overlap (&gt; 80%). Tiger density may have been too low (0.36/100 km2) to compel temporal avoidance by leopard and dhole where they overlapped. Our results suggest that low density populations of tigers and leopards can overlap in habitat use and temporal activity, despite the potential for intensified competition due to prey scarcity. Dholes were widespread despite scarcity of large ungulates, and seem more resilient to the loss of large-bodied prey than tigers. MWKL has an important role in conserving dholes, which are declining globally. © 2021",2021,"10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01930","32","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119908305&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2021.e01930&partnerID=40&md5=db437c9ae1da12f4dd743f4e3f68ebd2","Activity pattern and Camera trap survey and Co-occurrence and Competition and Occupancy and Spatio-temporal interactions",NA,NA,1

However, little is known about what factors relate their activity synchronization dynamics. With the climate change and human society development, the spatial-temporal distribution and activity synchronized rhythm of large carnivores and their prey would inevitably be affected, which would further affect the adaptability of large carnivores and bring new challenges to their conservation. In this study, we hypothesized the ambient temperature and human activity would influence the activity synchronization intensity among Amur tiger, Amur leopard and ungulates (roe deer, sika deer and wild boar) through cross-correlation function and temporal niche overlap model based on the camera traps data. The result show that the activity rhythms of the five target species showed species and seasonal differences, the temporal niche overlaps between ungulates were normally higher than that between the cats and prey, the weakest overlap was observed between the two big cat species, and time-lags of similar rhythmic activity can reduce the temporal overlap pressures of species. Furthermore, we found that ambient temperature relate interspecific synchrony of roe deer-sika deer and roe deer-wild boar pairs at the daily scale. And at hourly scale, temperature and human activities exerted significantly positive or negative stresses on the interspecific activity synchronization of all target species, observed in all three seasons. Our study provides new insights on our understanding of the mechanisms by which sympatric predators and ungulate prey coexist and interact in view of temporal niche overlap, as well as how wildlife managers can manage the mammal assembly effectively. As the Amur tiger and leopard populations in China are being recovered quickly, the rapidly increasing predation pressure and limited environmental resources could have profound implications for the interaction and coexistence among these two large carnivores and their ungulate prey. Managers should strengthen the monitoring, and understand its causes and consequences, so as to develop effective protective measures. © 2021",2021,"10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01899","32","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118491330&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2021.e01899&partnerID=40&md5=0edfb348315b46e38e05c7a051458515","Activity rhythm and Amur leopard and Amur tiger and Camera traps and Coexistence and Human activity and Synchronization intensity",NA,NA,2

The endangered spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) is the largest marsupial carnivore on mainland Australia and is sympatric with an introduced predator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Spotted-tailed quolls are considered a forest-dependent species and are often associated with large, intact forested habitats where abundance of prey is high and competition with foxes is low. Spotted-tailed quolls are known to persist in some fragmented habitats in sympatry with foxes; however, the mechanisms facilitating this coexistence are unclear. For 15 months in 2018–19, we used camera traps to investigate whether coexistence between quolls and foxes in a fragmented landscape was facilitated by spatial and/or temporal separation of activity. We found no evidence of spatial separation, with quolls detected on the majority of cameras where foxes were detected. There was considerable temporal overlap between quolls and foxes (Δ1 = 0.71–0.81) and no evidence that fox presence influenced the temporal activity of quolls (Δ1 = 0.76–0.80). Furthermore, there was no evidence of within-night spatiotemporal avoidance between quolls and foxes (R2 &lt; 0.01). Our findings suggest that quolls do not offset their spatial and temporal activity to avoid foxes in this fragmented landscape. The spatial and temporal sympatry between quolls and foxes is possibly facilitated by low fox density at this site, suggested by low fox detections. The lack of separation between quoll and fox activity could also explain why quolls become locally extinct in other fragmented landscapes because quolls may not modify their activity to avoid foxes. Future research should focus on investigating quoll and fox interactions along a gradient of fox densities and assess if higher fox densities influence spatial and temporal coexistence with quolls in fragmented landscapes. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London",2021,"10.1111/jzo.12919","315","english","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111708760&doi=10.1111%2fjzo.12919&partnerID=40&md5=05758c70ad8465729a6b15125a24daff","activity patterns and camera traps and Dasyurus maculatus and habitat fragmentation and mesopredator and species coexistence and Vulpes and Dasyurus and Dasyurus maculatus and Metatheria and Vulpes and Vulpes vulpes","276-287",NA,3

We studied niche segregation in a Mediterranean mesocarnivore community composed by Vulpes vulpes, Genetta genetta, Meles meles, and Herpestes ichneumon, addressing simultaneously different niche axes: the temporal, trophic, and spatial axes. We assessed temporal segregation between mesopredators and prey and between potential competitors, using camera trap data between 2018 and 2020 in a Mediterranean landscape in Southern Spain. We deployed camera traps in 35 stations in three sites with varying vegetation cover within Doñana National Park. We further examined the spatial overlap in activity centers and trophic preferences between potential competitors using diet information from studies performed in the study area. We found an overall temporal segregation between trophic generalist species, with species showing higher temporal overlap differing in their trophic preferences and/or showing limited spatial overlap. Furthermore, we observed an overall high overlap between the activity patterns of predators and their major prey in the area (the common genet vs. small mammals and the red fox vs. European rabbit). Our study suggests that coexistence of the different species that compose the mesocarnivore assemblage in Mediterranean landscapes can be facilitated by subtle differences along the three main niche axes, with temporal segregation being a most pronounced mechanism.

In the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico, shrub encroachment has prompted intensive efforts by land management agencies to remove shrubs and restore historical grassland habitats. We asked if restoration actions involving shrub removal affected dynamics of intraguild predation (IGP) including an IGP predator (coyote, Canis latrans), an IGP prey (kit fox, Vulpes macrotis), plus their shared lagomorph prey. We used camera traps on 14 sites with paired treated and untreated areas to examine spatial and temporal niche partitioning of coyotes and kit foxes. Shrub removal did not produce straightforward effects on abundances of coyotes, kit foxes, or their prey resources. Instead, abundances of kit foxes were constrained when coyote abundance reached a threshold. Below this threshold, kit foxes were more common on areas with low shrub cover, possibly due to lack of hiding cover for lagomorph prey that increased their predation risk. Our system included two alternative states: IGP predator dominated and coexistence of IGP predator and prey. Coexistence may have been facilitated by temporal niche partitioning as diel activity patterns differed for coyotes and kit foxes.

This is especially important inside protected areas (PAs), which often represent the last refugia for threatened large mammals. We used camera-traps to sample four areas with different protection status across the Mongolian Altai Mountains, and targeted a predator-prey system composed of livestock, one large herbivore, the Siberian ibex, and two large carnivores, the snow leopard and the wolf. To determine the effect of livestock on habitat use by the wild species and their spatio-temporal co-occurrence we applied an occupancy framework explicitly developed for modelling interacting species. We recorded a widespread presence of domestic animals in the PAs, and observed avoidance of sites used by livestock by snow leopard and ibex, while wolves tended to co-occur with it. Snow leopard and ibex showed clear mutual co-occurrence, indicating a tight predator-prey relationship. Results provide evidence that, at the scale of sites sampled primarily to maximise snow leopard detections, grazing livestock interferes with wild species by inducing avoidance in snow leopards, and attraction in wolves. We suggest that (1) PAs management should enforce real grazing limitations on the ground, especially in the core areas of the parks; (2) new policies incorporating wildlife conservation into government subsidies to pastoralists should be envisaged, to prevent increasing displacement of snow leopards and ibex; (3) as wolves co-occurred with livestock, with the potential for human-wildlife conflicts, we encourage the use of a set of prevention techniques to mitigate livestock depredation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109294","261","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112804332&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2021.109294&partnerID=40&md5=8bf2a1b46f65a83f5fcadee04ad7270c","Activity pattern and Camera-trapping and Canis lupus and Capra sibirica and Human-wildlife conflicts and Occupancy and Panthera uncia and canid and ecological modeling and felid and habitat use and livestock and livestock farming and nature conservation and occupational exposure and predator-prey interaction and protected area and species occurrence and wild population and Canidae and Canis lupus and Capra sibirica and Mammalia and Uncia uncia",NA,NA,6

Numerous coexistence mechanisms have been proposed, but species interactions can also be aggressive; thus, generally a subordinate species modifies its realized niche to limit the probability of direct encounters with the dominant species. We studied niche partitioning between two sympatric wild canids in north-eastern Italy: the golden jackal and the red fox, which, based on competition theories, have a high potential for competition. We considered four main niche dimensions: space, habitat, time, and diet. RESULTS: We investigated three study areas monitoring target species populations from March 2017 to November 2018 using non-invasive monitoring techniques. Red fox presence was ascertained in every study area, while golden jackal presence was not ascertained in one study area, where we collected data regarding wolf presence. Considering the two target species, we observed partial diet partitioning based on prey size, with the golden jackal mainly feeding on wild ungulates and the red fox mainly feeding on small mammals. The two canids had an extensive temporal overlap along the diel cycle, having both predominant crepuscular and nocturnal activity patterns, but marked spatial partitioning and differential use of habitats. The golden jackal proved to be specialist concerning the habitat dimension, while the red fox resulted completely generalist: the former selected less human-modified habitats and avoided intensively cultivated lands, while the latter was present in all habitats, including intensively cultivated lands. CONCLUSIONS: The observed partitioning might be due partially to some ecological adaptations (e.g. specialist vs. generalist use of resources) and specific behaviours (e.g. cooperative vs. solitary hunting) and partially to the avoidance response of the red fox aimed at reducing the probability of direct encounters with the golden jackal.",2021,"10.1186/s12862-021-01860-3","21","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109009838&doi=10.1186%2fs12862-021-01860-3&partnerID=40&md5=313493d3a19c96acb151fbdae70ff627","Activity patterns and Camera trapping and Competition and Diet and Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and Interference and Niche overlap and Niche partitioning and Scat analysis and Utilization distributions and animal and fox and Italy and jackal and sympatry and wolf and Animals and Foxes and Italy and Jackals and Sympatry and Wolves","129",NA,7

In African ecosystems, reduced prey populations and the loss of competing guild members, most notably lion (Panthera leo), are expected to increase the levels of competition between remaining carnivores. Consequently, intraguild relationships can be altered, potentially increasing the risk of further population decline. Kasungu National Park (KNP), Malawi, is an example of a conservation area that has experienced large-scale reductions in both carnivore and prey populations, leaving a resident large carnivore guild consisting of only leopard (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). Here, we quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of these two species and their degree of association, using a combination of co-detection modeling, time-to-event analyses, and temporal activity patterns from camera trap data. The detection of leopard and spotted hyena was significantly associated with the detection of preferred prey and competing carnivores, increasing the likelihood of species interaction. Temporal analyses revealed sex-specific differences in temporal activity, with female leopard activity patterns significantly different to those of spotted hyena and male conspecifics. Heightened risk of interaction with interspecific competitors and male conspecifics may have resulted in female leopards adopting temporal avoidance strategies to facilitate coexistence. Female leopard behavioral adaptations increased overall activity levels and diurnal activity rates, with potential consequences for overall fitness and exposure to sources of mortality. As both species are currently found at low densities in KNP, increased risk of competitive interactions, which infer a reduction in fitness, could have significant implications for large carnivore demographics. The protection of remaining prey populations is necessary to mitigate interspecific competition and avoid further alterations to the large carnivore guild. © 2021 The Authors.

Through a pioneer study in North-West Africa based on a camera-trapping survey, we studied ecology features of a carnivores’ community in the Middle Atlas Mountains, Morocco. We focused on how species shared (or not) the territory and their activity patterns. Camera trapping detected five carnivorous species: African golden wolf (Canis lupaster), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), genet (Genetta genetta) and African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica). Generalized Linear Models confirmed different habitat selection patterns between these species. The presence of a small protected area or prey availability apparently were not determinant factors in the abundance of these species. Spatial segregation patterns were observed between the red fox with the domestic dog and between the red fox with the genet. Kernel density estimates showed strong temporal segregation of red fox and African golden wolf with regard to domestic dog, and suggested avoidance mechanisms for the triad red fox, genet and African golden wolf.

Competition between large carnivores can exacerbate this decline. While brown hyena Parahyaena brunnea and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta belong to the same family, they are rarely found in the same area or co-occur at low densities as spotted hyena are known to exclude brown hyena. In Central Tuli, Botswana, however, brown hyena and spotted hyena are both found at high densities. We undertook a camera trap survey in this area to estimate the densities of both species, and to examine temporal overlap and co-detection patterns of brown and spotted hyena. Estimated population densities based on spatial capture–recapture models were 10.5 ± 1.9/100 km2 for brown hyena and 14.9 ± 2.2/100 km2 for spotted hyena. These population densities are among the highest reported estimates in southern Africa. Strong temporal overlap was found between brown and spotted hyena, while there was no decrease in detection rate of brown hyena at camera sites where spotted hyena were also detected, which indicates that both hyena species did not tend to avoid encounters. Although both species compete for the same prey, we suggest as possible explanations that prey densities are high and that competition does not significantly negatively impact brown hyena, because brown hyena is a scavenger whereas spotted hyena scavenge and kill prey. With the found high densities of both carnivores, this study adds to the known variation in composition of existing large carnivore communities and suggests testable explanations for these densities. © 2021 The Authors.

The jungle cat (Felis chaus) is a DDF specialist that occurs only in small isolated populations in Southeast Asia. Despite being one of the rarest felids in the region, almost nothing is known about its ecology. We investigated the ecology of jungle cats and their resource partitioning with the more common leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) in a DDF-dominated landscape in Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary, Cambodia. We used camera-trap data collected from 2009 to 2019 and DNA-confirmed scats to determine the temporal, dietary and spatial overlap between jungle cats and leopard cats. The diet of jungle cats was relatively diverse and consisted of murids (56% biomass consumed), sciurids (15%), hares (Lepus peguensis; 12%), birds (8%), and reptiles (8%), whereas leopard cats had a narrower niche breadth and a diet dominated by smaller prey, primarily murids (73%). Nonetheless, dietary overlap was high because both felid species consumed predominantly small rodents. Both species were primarily nocturnal and had high temporal overlap. Two-species occupancy modelling suggested jungle cats were restricted to DDF and had low occupancy, whereas leopard cats had higher occupancy and were habitat generalists. Our study confirmed that jungle cats are DDF specialists that likely persist in low numbers due to the harsh conditions of the dry season in this habitat, including annual fires and substantial decreases in small vertebrate prey. The lower occupancy and more diverse diet of jungle cats, together with the broader habitat use of leopard cats, likely facilitated the coexistence of these species. The low occupancy of jungle cats in DDF suggests that protection of large areas of DDF will be required for the long-term conservation of this rare felid in Southeast Asia. © 2021 The Authors.

Understanding livestock-wildlife interactions is crucial for rare large carnivores conservation. In China, free-ranging cattle within forests degrade the habitat of the tigers (Panthera tigris) and leopards (Panthera pardus), but quantitative assessments of how livestock affect the spatial and temporal use by the major ungulate prey of the two endangered felids are very limited. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the interactions of several sympatric wildlife species with livestock at a fine spatiotemporal scale in a human-dominated forest landscape. Methods: Based on a large-scale camera-trapping data across the China-Russia border, we used N-mixture models, two-species occupancy models and activity pattern overlap to understand the effects of cattle grazing on three ungulate species (sika deer Cervus nippon, wild boars Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus pygargus). Results: Spatially, with cattle activity increasing, wild boar and roe deer had different degrees of decline in the intensity of habitat use. Sika deer were displaced as more cattle encroached on forest habitat. Temporally, in the presence of cattle, wild boar and sika deer decreased their activities in the day. In addition, three wild ungulates trend to exhibit lower spatiotemporal overlap with cattle at shared camera sites. Conclusions: Our study shows that wildlife species may reduce the probability of habitat use by spatial avoidance and changing the daily activity patterns. We underscore that fine-scale (i.e. camera-site level) spatiotemporal avoidance is likely a key component of co-occurrence between livestock and the sympatry of competing ungulates inhabiting forest ecosystems.

We used the Kernel density estimation to generate species activity patterns and the overlap between both cats. We then calculated the overlap coefficient (Δ) by carrying out 10,000 bootstraps (95%). Both cats were active 24 h a day. The puma has higher nocturnal activity (57%), whilst jaguar activity is split almost equally between night (53%) and day (47%). We did not find temporal segregation between jaguars and pumas, which showed similar activity patterns with a high overlapping coefficient (Δ4 = 0.84; 0.78-0.91). Also, we did not find significant differences between Male and Female activity patterns for both species (X2 = 0.50, gl = 1, P = 0.47). Moreover, both cats had significant overlap with the activity patterns of their main prey. Temporal segregation was not detected in any of our study sites within the Greater Madidi-Tambopata Landscape, suggesting that in this region, these predators employ other mechanisms to avoid competition. © 2021 De Gruyter.

Anthropogenic-altered landscapes can benefit some species and adversely affect others. For some carnivores, prey availability increases with urbanization, but landscape use can be complicated by interactions among carnivores as well as differing human tolerance of some species. We used camera traps to survey along a gradient of urban, rural, and forest cover to quantify how carnivore landscape use varies among guild members and determine if a species was a human exploiter, adapter, or avoider. Our study was conducted in and around Corvallis, Oregon from April 2018 to February 2019 (11,914 trap nights) using 47 camera trap locations on a gradient from urban to rural. Our focal species were bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Raccoon and opossum were human exploiters with low use of forest cover and positive association with urban and rural developed areas likely due to human-derived resources as well as some refugia from larger predators. Coyote and gray fox were human adapters with high use of natural habitats while the effects of urbanization ranged from weak to indiscernible. Bobcat and striped skunk appeared to be human avoiders with negative relationship with urban cover and higher landscape use of forest cover. We conducted a diel temporal activity analysis and found mostly nocturnal activity within the guild, but more diurnal activity by larger-bodied predators compared to the smaller species. Although these species coexist as a community in human-dominated landscapes throughout much of North America, the effects of urbanization were not equal across species. Our results, especially for gray fox and striped skunk, are counter to research in other regions, suggesting that mesopredator use of urbanized landscapes can vary depending on the environmental conditions of the study area and management actions are likely to be most effective when decisions are based on locally derived data. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

Moon phases may also play an important role in shaping wild mammals’ activity rhythms with prey showing peaks of activity in darkest nights. Camera trapping has enriched the possibility to conduct systematic studies of activity patterns and temporal niche overlap on mammalian guilds. In this study, we used camera traps to investigate intra-guild interactions and temporal partitioning among three meso-carnivores and their common prey in two Mongolian areas characterized, respectively, by a grassland and a forest–alpine meadow. We detected a moderate–high interspecific overlap in red foxes, pikas and tolai hares. We found a moderate overlap of temporal activity patterns among nocturnal carnivores as well as among nocturnal prey species. Interestingly, we observed a moderate overlap between hares and meso-carnivores. Amongst nocturnal species, the red fox and the stoat had a peak in activity in the brightest nights, the stone marten and the Mongolian silver vole preferred to range in dark nights, whereas activity of the tolai hare was not dependent on moon phases.

Camera trapping in winter and summer 2014–2015 (n = 95 stations) showed that leopards had high temporal overlap with aardvark (Orycteropus afer) and lagomorphs, and partial overlap with red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), the only reintroduced ungulate present in leopard diet (n = 82 scats). Goats (Capra hircus) had the lowest temporal overlap with leopard but comprised most biomass in leopard scat. Sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos sp.) also had generally low temporal overlap with leopards, with cattle contributing less biomass to leopard diet than sheep. Leopards were active primarily at night across seasons (n = 103 photos). These results suggest that leopards hunted at night when prey were resting and presumably less vigilant, or that they effectively predated some species during daylight.

However, camera-trap studies are seldom executed at a broad spatial scale. We demonstrate how uniting fine-scale studies and utilizing camera-trap data of non-target species is an effective approach for broadscale assessments through a case study of the brown hyaena Parahyaena brunnea. We collated camera-trap data from 25 protected and unprotected sites across South Africa into the largest detection/non-detection dataset collected on the brown hyaena, and investigated the influence of biological and anthropogenic factors on brown hyaena occupancy. Spatial autocorrelation had a significant effect on the data, and was corrected using a Bayesian Gibbs sampler. We show that brown hyaena occupancy is driven by specific co-occurring apex predator species and human disturbance. The relative abundance of spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta and people on foot had a negative effect on brown hyaena occupancy, whereas the relative abundance of leopards Panthera pardus and vehicles had a positive influence. We estimated that brown hyaenas occur across 66% of the surveyed camera-trap station sites. Occupancy varied geographically, with lower estimates in eastern and southern South Africa. Our findings suggest that brown hyaena conservation is dependent upon a multi-species approach focussed on implementing conservation policies that better facilitate coexistence between people and hyaenas. We also validate the conservation value of pooling fine-scale datasets and utilizing bycatch data to examine species trends at broad spatial scales. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

Human disturbance events (e.g., domestic dogs, livestock, and humans, including armed hunters) comprised 38% of all photographs at high disturbance sites and 29% of all photographs at low disturbance sites. Differential spatiotemporal overlaps were recorded between felids and their prey at high versus low disturbance sites, with jaguars exhibiting only 13% temporal overlap with humans at high disturbance sites. Among prey, temporal overlap was greater than spatial overlap for both felids across the study area. Compared to jaguars, pumas displayed more temporal overlap with all anthropogenic variables and more spatial overlap with most anthropogenic variables, suggesting lesser sensitivity to human disturbances.

We estimated the interspecific patterns of the spatiotemporal activity rhythms of brown hares, its potential predators (the red fox Vulpes vulpes, the pine marten Martes martes, the domestic cat Felis catus, and the domestic dog Canis familiaris), and a competitor, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus. Brown hare activity was studied in natural conditions as well as in a fenced area that excluded terrestrial predators and competitors. Free-ranging hares developed a more nocturnal behavior to avoid diurnal predators (i.e., domestic carnivores and martens). Although high temporal overlap was observed between free-ranging brown hares and both red foxes (82%) and roe deer (81%), hares avoided fox by being more active on darkest nights, as well as avoided roe deer through spatial partitioning.

Our results indicated that leopard prefers medium-sized prey such as wild pig, common langur and barking deer represented 60% of the total biomass consumed collectively. Results of 6413 camera trap night in 187 locations revealed that leopards showed cathemeral activity pattern and exhibited positive co-occurrence pattern and significant spatial and temporal overlap with their main prey, the wild pig. However, leopards showed very low spatial and temporal overlap with the second main prey, the common langur. Leopards avoided humans and showed low spatial and temporal overlap with humans.

Using a community-based conservation approach, we investigated temporal niche partitioning of mammalian predators and prey across 12 long-term camera trap surveys in the Pacific slope and Talamanca Cordillera of Costa Rica. Temporal overlap and segregation were investigated between predator-prey and predator-predator pairs using overlap analysis, circular statistics, and relative abundance after accounting for differences in habitat, season, and human impact among sites. We made the assumption that predators select abundant prey and adjust their activity to maximize their temporal overlap, thus we predicted that abundant prey with high overlap would be preferred prey species for that predator. We also predicted that similar-sized pairs of predator species with the greatest potential for competitive interactions would have the highest temporal segregation. Our results supported the existence of temporal niche separation among the eight species of predators - the smaller Leopardus felids (ocelot, margay, oncilla) were primarily nocturnal, the largest felids (jaguar and puma) and coyote were cathemeral, and the smaller jaguarundi and tayra were mostly diurnal. Most prey species (67%) were primarily nocturnal versus diurnal or cathemeral (33%). Hierarchical clustering identified relationships among species with the most similar activity patterns. We discuss the primary prey and competitor species predicted for each of the eight predators. Contrary to our prediction, the activity pattern of similar-sized intraguild competitors overlapped more than dissimilar-sized competitors, suggesting that similar-sized predators are hunting the same prey at the same time. From this we conclude that prey availability is more important than competition in determining circadian activity patterns of Neotropical predators. Our results indicate the presence of a delicate balance of tropical food webs that may be disrupted by overhunting, leading to a depauperate community consisting of ubiquitous generalists and endangered specialists.

We assessed the temporal and spatiotemporal interactions between Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) and six focal sympatric species in South Florida, where Florida panther abundance has increased by more than 6-fold since the 1990's. Using camera trap data, we quantified species' diel activity patterns, temporal overlap, and time-to-encounter (i.e., time between consecutive visits of a Florida panther and a focal species and vice versa). The Florida panther and bobcat (Lynx rufus) displayed a nocturnal activity pattern; the black bear (Ursus americanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) were mostly diurnal; and the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was cathemeral. Prey species and black bears minimized encounters with Florida panthers by being active during the day and displaying longer time-to-encounter, whereas Florida panthers visited a site after a prey species at higher probabilities than after competitor species, and were more likely to visit an elevated site or upland habitat. Our results suggest that interactions between Florida panthers and sympatric species in our study system are driven by species-specific behavioral responses. Gaining a better understanding of the crucial interactions driving species coexistence is important for a better understanding of the structure and function of ecological communities and help manage the potential expansion of the Florida panther into Central Florida. © 2020 The Author(s).

In contrast to leopard cats, little is known about the ecology of Asian golden cats, and resource partitioning between these species has not been studied. We used DNA-confirmed scats, camera-trap data, and prey surveys, to determine the diet, prey selection, and activity, of Asian golden cats and leopard cats in a protected area in northern Laos. The two felids had different diets: Asian golden cats consumed mostly ungulates (35% biomass consumed), murid rodents (23%), and carnivores (15%), whereas leopard cats consumed mostly murid rodents (79%). Asian golden cats were not random in their consumption of ungulates, because muntjac (Muntiacus spp.) were selectively consumed over larger ungulates, indicating muntjac were preyed upon rather than scavenged. Dietary overlap between the two felid species was moderate (R0 = 0.60), and the dietary niche breadth of Asian golden cats (B = 8.44) was nearly twice as high as that of leopard cats (4.54). The mean (± SD) scat diameter was greater for Asian golden cats (2.1 ± 0.3 cm) than leopard cats (1.8 ± 0.2 cm), although diameters of leopard cat scats were considerably larger than previously assumed for this species. The felid species differed in their activity patterns, because Asian golden cats were diurnal, whereas leopard cats were nocturnal, although they did not differ in their use of elevation, suggesting there was no habitat segregation. Overall, leopard cats appeared to coexist with Asian golden cats, a potential predator and competitor, by exhibiting dietary and temporal partitioning. Our results showed that muntjac were important prey of Asian golden cats, suggesting the management of muntjac might be important for conserving populations of Asian golden cats. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Niche partitioning is a common strategy applied by species to enhance their coexistence. Diet, habitat, or time use can be responsible for segregation among carnivore species, the latter factor being the least studied in Mediterranean ecosystems. Terrestrial medium-sized carnivores (i.e., mesocarnivores) carry out important functions in ecosystems, and identifying their interactions is essential for their conservation. In this study, we explore the activity of a terrestrial mesocarnivore guild in order to determine seasonal differences in daily activity patterns of competitors and prey. We also investigate how the abundance of a common mesocarnivore prey in the region, small mammals, influences the activity of predators. During a year, camera trap devices (n = 18) were installed in Montseny Natural Park (Catalan Pre-Coastal Range, North-East Iberian Peninsula), a region that hosts five mesocarnivore species. Camera trapping detections were used to estimate their daily activity patterns and corresponding overlaps. We also surveyed small mammal plots (n = 5) in order to calculate prey abundance and test its effect on the relative activity of each carnivore species. Despite all target mesocarnivores are mainly nocturnal, the activity overlap among them varies according to species particularities and season. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) appears as a generalist species in terms of time use, whereas stone marten (Martes foina) and genet (Genetta genetta) show the most similar activity patterns and both of them seem to be positively influenced by small mammal abundance. Overall, the diversity found in the way mesocarnivore species use time could facilitate their coexistence. Despite activity pattern similarities among carnivore species should not be directly translated to negative interactions, they can have a strong influence in habitat and resource-limited ecosystems. Therefore, activity overlaps should be taken into account when discussing wildlife management actions. © 2020 The Authors.

Using camera trap data from 2013 to 2017, we investigated the temporal partitioning of a community of wild felids and a canid in Nam Et–Phou Louey National Protected Area, Laos, to determine the extent to which temporal avoidance might be facilitating coexistence of similarly sized carnivores. We also investigated temporal overlap of these carnivore species and their presumed main prey, to determine if their activity is likely most influenced by their prey or potential competitors. The dhole (Cuon alpinus) and clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), the two largest carnivores, had low temporal overlap, and activity appeared to be synchronized with the main prey for dhole, but not clouded leopard. Thus, it was possible that clouded leopard used temporal partitioning to coexist with dhole. The temporal overlap of Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) was high with clouded leopard and moderate with dhole, and overall appeared to be influenced most by its presumed prey species, rather than by its potential competitors. The two small felids had the least temporal overlap between any species, as the marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata) was primarily diurnal whereas the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was primarily nocturnal. Given that the two small felids reportedly have similar diets consisting of small rodents and birds, their temporal partitioning is likely to help facilitate their coexistence. For carnivore species in northern Laos that are most similar in body size and diet, temporal partitioning is likely to be an important mechanism of coexistence. Otherwise, temporal patterns appear to be synchronized with their main prey. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,"10.1007/s13364-020-00524-9","65","english","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089373654&doi=10.1007%2fs13364-020-00524-9&partnerID=40&md5=a86234fe73c6538833cdb117f8d980e9","Activity pattern and Asian golden cat and Clouded leopard and Dhole and Lao PDR and Leopard cat and Marbled cat and avoidance reaction and bird and body size and canid and carnivore and coexistence and diurnal activity and facilitation and felid and nocturnal activity and prey capture and protected area and rodent and sympatry and temporal analysis and Laos and Aves and Canidae and Catopuma temminckii and Cuon alpinus and Felidae and Neofelis nebulosa and Pardofelis marmorata and Prionailurus bengalensis and Rodentia","679-689",NA,28

Similarly, we found high nocturnal, temporal overlap between pumas and foxes that matched peaks in activity of prey. In contrast, we found relatively low dietary overlap indicating niche segregation likely occurs along the dietary axis. The Puma diet was dominated by introduced, exotic hares and foxes appeared to shift away from hares to rabbits, small mammals, and seeds.

We examined their daily activity patterns at camera traps (19 sampling sites) in the boreal forest of northwest Alberta (2380 km2).

However, we have a limited understanding of the drivers of the distribution and abundance of feral cats at a landscape scale, including whether the occurrence of a top predator, the dingo (Canis familiaris [dingo]), limits feral cat populations. We modelled feral cat and dingo site occurrence, to provide the first broad-scale assessment of their distributional patterns and co-occurrence within monsoonal Australia. Location: About 370,000 km2 of monsoonal area in the Northern Territory. Methods: We surveyed 376 sites using camera traps. We used single- and two-species occupancy models to investigate feral cat and dingo site occurrence and the influence of dingoes on feral cat occupancy. We included predictor variables that relate to hypotheses of predator occurrence, including both environmental and disturbance-related variables. Results: Feral cat occurrence and dingo occurrence were best predicted by indices of habitat structural complexity; feral cat occurrence declined with increasing productivity, except in areas of relatively high fire activity (fire frequency and extent), and dingo occurrence declined with terrain ruggedness. We found no evidence that dingoes are spatially limiting feral cat occurrence. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest the protection and enhancement of habitat structural complexity at both the local and landscape scale could enable conservation managers to reduce the exposure of small- and medium-sized mammals to feral cats and dingoes. This can most likely be achieved through improved fire and feral herbivore management, which is a more feasible management option than lethal predator control. © 2020 The Authors.

Here, we investigated the temporal ecology of mesocarnivores which co-occur in a semiarid area where top predators are virtually absent. More specifically, we (i) describe the daily activity patterns of six mesocarnivore species, (ii) evaluate possible seasonal changes in their daily activity patterns, (iii) examine patterns of temporal overlap among mesocarnivores, and (iv) test the overlap in daily activity between mesocarnivores and their potential prey. Using camera-trapping data (13,976 camera-days) and circular and overlapping analyses, we studied six out of the seven mesocarnivore species recorded. Striped hog-nosed skunk and the crab-eating raccoon were nocturnal, crab-eating fox and northern tiger cat were nocturnal-crepuscular, ocelot was mainly nocturnal, and jaguarundi was diurnal. With the exception of jaguarundi, we fail to find strong temporal segregation among mesocarnivore and interspecific interactions did not vary seasonally, but we observed separation in their activity peaks and significant difference in their activity distributions. This partial temporal segregation can potentially contribute to interspecific coexistence, reducing the chances of interspecific killing, mainly in relation to the dominant species (ocelot). Mesocarnivores did not exhibit a significant synchrony of their activity with any of the preys evaluated, with the exception of jaguarundi, which significantly overlapped its distribution of activity with some preys.

Mesocarnivores may be affected by the threat of the apex carnivore; they mainly avoided leopards spatially, showing low spatial overlap with leopards in all seasons.

Industrial landscape change creates a novel playing field on which these interactions take place, and a key question for wildlife managers is whether and how species are able to coexist in such working landscapes. Using camera traps deployed in northern Alberta, we surveyed boreal predators to determine whether interspecific interactions affected occurrences of black bears (Ursus americanus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and lynx (Lynx canadensis) within a landscape disturbed by networks of seismic lines (corridors cut for seismic exploration of oil and gas reserves). We tested hypotheses of species interactions across one spatial-only and two spatiotemporal (daily and weekly) scales. Specifically, we hypothesized that (1) predators avoid competition with the apex predator, gray wolf (Canis lupus), (2) they avoid competition with each other as intraguild competitors, and (3) they overlap with their prey. All three predators overlapped with wolves on at least one scale, although models at the daily and weekly scale had substantial unexplained variance. None of the predators showed avoidance of intraguild competitors or overlap with prey. These results show patterns in predator space use that are consistent with both facilitative interactions or shared responses to unmeasured ecological cues.

Wildlife habitat has a particularly strong human presence in the Mediterranean Basin where human population density is high. However, relatively little is known on the interaction and impact of humans on wildlife in much of the Mediterranean region. In this study, we recorded the interactions among several important wildlife species, humans, and domestic animals in a forested Mediterranean landscape in southern Turkey using camera traps. We sought to understand how the presence of humans and domestic animals such as feral dogs (Canis familiaris) and livestock impacted the behavior of the main wildlife species in the region such as caracal (Caracal caracal), fallow deer (Dama dama), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). A total of 4209 photographs from 9 species were captured over a 154-week period. Data were analyzed for both monthly and daily co-occurrences among species using multivariate and univariate techniques. Cluster analyses revealed that while human, wild boar, and fallow deer co-occupied the same area and time, other wildlife species avoided areas used by humans, feral dogs, and livestock which tended to co-occur. Regression analyses revealed that caracal inhabited the same areas as wild boar and European hare (Lepus europaeus), but avoided areas visited by humans and fallow deer on a daily basis. These results suggest that while humans and feral dogs inhabit the same area as wildlife in the region, wildlife species including top predators such as caracal avoid localities recently visited by humans and feral dogs. As a consequence, increasing human activity and feral dog populations has the potential to impact foraging, resting, and hunting behavior of local wildlife and poses a threat to the continued existence of these species in the area. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,"10.1007/s10344-019-1343-x","66","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076550273&doi=10.1007%2fs10344-019-1343-x&partnerID=40&md5=a46f13ef9e204754cb290876851979ff","Camera trap and Caracal (Caracal caracal) and Mediterranean landscape and Turkey and Wildlife-human interaction",NA,NA,37

We collected camera trap data from 106 locations over 1,817 trap nights. Kernel density estimation and Spearman’s rank correlation were used to quantify temporal and spatial activity patterns. Pianka’s index was used to investigate the temporal and spatial overlap for each species pair. Tigers (crepuscular activity pattern) showed no temporal correlation with leopards (mostly diurnal) or dholes (strongly diurnal), but leopard activity appeared to correlate positively with dhole activity. Tigers exhibited temporal overlap with larger gaur (Bos gaurus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor); leopards did so with barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak) and wild boar (Sus scrofa); and dholes did so with barking deer and wild boar. The spatial correlations of tigers, leopards, and dholes did not significantly overlap, though numerically overlap was higher between felids than with the canid. None of the three predators significantly correlated with prey distribution, except for dholes with sambar. Our findings suggest that tigers, leopards, and dholes co-occur with spatial and temporal partitioning due to differences in prey activity and low overlap in space use correlated to prey preference. The partition in space and time between tigers and leopards can minimise their competition-associated prey activity, while leopards and dholes seem to be more generalist and not spatially correlated with each other. © National University of Singapore.",2020,"10.26107/RBZ-2020-0013","68","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084440944&doi=10.26107%2fRBZ-2020-0013&partnerID=40&md5=863a6e1e14976867245f9b2af3bb6f24","Activity and Barking deer and Camera trap and Dhole and Gaur and Leopard and Malayan tapir and Sambar and Tiger and Wild boar","118-131",NA,38

We assessed spatiotemporal resource partitioning between leopards and lions and hypothesized the differential use of spatiotemporal resources by leopards with respect to lions. We used a systematic camera trap survey to collect the data at 50 sites. The data were analyzed using overlap indices, and non-parametric test statistics to assess the spatiotemporal associations. Leopard and lion were crepuscular and nocturnal in their activity pattern. They did not segregate temporally and showed substantially high overlap and strong temporal association. Leopard segregates with lion spatially by overlapping less and showing no association in space use at specific camera trap sites. Leopards showed preference for dense habitats, while the lion preferred both dense and open habitats. Leopard showed moderate-overlap and positive association with key prey species, i.e., chital and sambar. Lion, however showed low site-specific overlap and negative association with its crucial prey species, i.e., sambar and wild pig. We conclude that site-specific spatial partitioning along with differential affinities for habitat is helping leopards to partition their spatio-temporal resources with lions and hence facilitate coexistence of leopards with lions in Gir forest. © 2020 Chaudhary et al.

For example, elimination of buffalo from the Serengeti National Park is suggested to have driven increased abundance of smaller antelope as a result of release from competition. The perceived low abundance of small antelope in the contractual Postberg section of the West Coast National Park (the park) has been an ongoing management concern which has been anecdotally attributed to predation by a mesopredator (the caracal, Caracal caracal). However, we hypothesized that the historical overstocking, and consequent overgrazing by larger-bodied managed ungulates would influence small antelope abundance. Using camera traps, we investigated species co-occurrence and temporal activity between small antelope, managed ungulates and caracals in Postberg as well as another part of the park (Langebaan) and a farm outside of the park. Results suggest that small antelope and managed ungulates have a high degree of temporal overlap (1 = 0.74, 0.79 and 0.86 for the farm, Langebaan and Postberg respectively), while temporal partitioning between small antelope and caracal is apparent (1 = 0.59). Further, small antelope and managed ungulates appear to occur independently of one another (SIF = 0.91–1 across areas). Managed ungulates were detected almost three times more frequently on fallow lands when compared to the more vegetated sites within the park suggesting that segregated food/cover resources allow for independent occurrence. Small antelope had a much higher probability of occurrence outside of the protected area (e.g., ψ = 0.192 and 0.486 for steenbok at Postberg, Langebaan compared to 0.841 on the farm), likely due to less variable (more intact) habitat outside of the protected area. There is not sufficient evidence to currently warrant management intervention for predators. The small size of the protected area provides limited scope for spatial replication thus reducing possibilities to infer the cause and effect for complex interactions (which would historically have taken place over much larger areas) with negative implications for adaptive management. We recommend continued monitoring over multiple seasons and a wider area to determine the spatial information requirements to inform management of small protected areas. © Copyright 2020 Winterton et al.",2020,"10.7717/peerj.8184","2020","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079045941&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.8184&partnerID=40&md5=1a4f53dcf4b7bf291c1c56d5b70fd28d","Caracal and Common duiker and Habitat and Land-use and Over-stocking and Steenbok and Temporal segregation and Ungulates and Unmarked and Vegetation structure and antelope and article and habitat and land use and nonhuman and predator and probability and seashore and season and South Africa and ungulate and vegetation",NA,NA,40

For the Vulnerable snow leopard Panthera uncia, wild prey reduction, intensifying human-wildlife conflicts and retaliatory killings are severe threats potentially exacerbated by the presence of livestock. Elucidating patterns of co-occurrence of snow leopards, wild ungulate prey, and livestock, can be used to assess the compatibility of pastoralism with conservation. We used camera trapping to study the interactions of livestock, Siberian ibex Capra sibirica and snow leopards in a national park in the Altai mountains, Mongolia. We obtained 494 detections of wild mammals and 912 of domestic ungulates, dogs and humans. Snow leopards and Siberian ibex were recorded 14 and 33 times, respectively. Co-occurrence modelling showed that livestock had a higher estimated occupancy (0.65) than ibex, whose occupancy was lower in the presence of livestock (0.11) than in its absence (0.34-0.35 depending on scenarios modelled). Snow leopard occupancy did not appear to be affected by the presence of livestock or ibex but the robustness of such inference was limited by uncertainty around the estimates. Although our sampling at presumed snow leopard passing sites may have led to fewer ibex detections, results indicate that livestock may displace wild ungulates, but may not directly affect the occurrence of snow leopards. Snow leopards could still be threatened by livestock, as overstocking can trigger human-carnivore conflicts and hamper the conservation of large carnivores.

A multiscale spatiotemporal study of dingoes and feral cats in Australia suggests not","Fancourt, B.A. and Cremasco, P. and Wilson, C. and Gentle, M.N.","Journal of Applied Ecology","The role of apex predators in structuring ecosystems through the suppression of mesopredator activity and abundance is receiving increasing attention, largely due to the potential benefits for biodiversity conservation. In Australia, invasive mesopredators such as feral cats (Felis catus) have been identified as major contributors to Australia's mass mammal extinctions since European arrival. The introduced dingo (Canis familiaris) has been proposed as a novel way to suppress the impacts of feral cats, however, scientific evidence of the dingo's suppressive role is equivocal. We used camera traps to investigate whether a large introduced predator (dingo) suppresses the activity of an established introduced mesopredator (feral cat) across a national park site conserving endangered species, and an agricultural site supporting cattle grazing enterprises. Feral cats and dingoes exhibited marked overlap in both temporal and spatial activity, indicating coexistence. Some temporal separation was evident at the agricultural site, however, this reflected higher diurnal activity by dingoes, not a responsive shift in cat activity. Cat activity times were unrelated to dingo presence and did not differ between areas occupied by dingoes and dingo-free areas. There was no evidence of dingoes excluding cats from patches at either site, nor was there evidence of within-night fine-scale spatiotemporal avoidance of dingoes by cats. Species co-occurrence models revealed dingoes had no negative effect on the probability of cat presence. The probability of detecting a cat on the national park was significantly higher in areas with dingoes than in dingo-free areas, while on agricultural land, cat detectability did not differ between areas with and without dingoes. Cats remained active, abundant and widespread across both sites, with evidence of cats hunting and breeding successfully in areas occupied by dingoes. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that feral cats can coexist with dingoes, without apparent suppression of cat activity, abundance or fitness. Proposals to reintroduce or restore dingoes and other large predators to suppress invasive mesopredators and conserve biodiversity should be carefully evaluated on a site-by-site basis, as their ability to suppress cats and protect species of conservation significance will likely be context dependent. © 2019 State of Queensland.

Both tigers and leopards showed crepuscular activity patterns with a high overlap but tigers were less active during the day compared to leopards. Leopards’ activity in the day increased in the presence of tigers. Tiger and leopard diet overlapped considerably (90%). Compared to leopards, tigers consumed a higher proportion of the large prey and a smaller proportion of livestock.

We assessed the activity pattern of the stone marten Martes foina in relation to its potential prey, the Himalayan woolly hare Lepus oiostolus and the Royle's pika Ochotona roylei, and its predators, the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the free-ranging dog Canis familiaris. Using three years of camera trapping data from the Indian Trans-Himalaya, we estimated individual and pair-wise spatio-temporal niche width and overlap, respectively, using Levins’ asymmetric index. Stone martens showed limited space use (spatial niche width 0.16) and nocturnal activity (temporal niche width 0.35). They had high temporal (0.75) and low spatial overlap (0.05) with hares; while they had relatively low temporal (0.33) but higher spatial overlap (0.29) with pikas. Red foxes showed relatively high temporal (1.21) and spatial (0.75) overlap with martens, while free-ranging dogs showed low temporal (0.23) and spatial (0.03) overlap with martens. Although restricted space and time use by pikas might help martens track pikas even with relatively low spatio-temporal overlap, martens may be benefiting from higher temporal overlap with hares.

We examined fine-scale co-occurrence between sympatric apex predators across a large and highly variable landscape characterized by anthropogenic presence and related mortality in Idaho, USA. We analyzed data from 201 camera traps across 130,000 km2 to examine spatiotemporal associations between four apex predators: humans (Homo sapiens), wolves (Canis lupus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and cougars (Puma concolor). We hypothesized that the dominant competitors in our system would be associated with reduced detections of subordinate competitors (i.e., humans &gt; wolves &gt; black bears &gt; cougars). Such a hierarchy proved true only when examining spatial associations between humans and wolves. We found a positive spatial association between black bear and cougars, suggesting that cougar kills may provide scavenging opportunities for bears. Although we found a slight positive spatial association between black bears and wolves, we found strong differences in temporal activity patterns between them. Mesic forest yielded higher detections of all predators (except humans) compared to xeric habitat. Cougars in particular appeared to be better predicted by habitat than presence of sympatric predators with more detections in mesic compared to mountain and xeric habitats.

Interactions between carnivores, including competition and predation, comprise important processes regulating local community structure and diversity. We use data from an intensive camera-trapping monitoring program across eight Neotropical forest sites to describe the patterns of spatiotemporal organization of a guild of five sympatric cat species: jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) and margay (Leopardus wiedii). For the three largest cat species, we developed multi-stage occupancy models accounting for habitat characteristics (landscape complexity and prey availability) and models accounting for species interactions (occupancy estimates of potential competitor cat species). Patterns of habitat-use were best explained by prey availability, rather than habitat structure or species interactions, with no evidence of negative associations of jaguar on puma and ocelot occupancy or puma on ocelot occupancy. We further explore temporal activity patterns and overlap of all five felid species. We observed a moderate temporal overlap between jaguar, puma and ocelot, with differences in their activity peaks, whereas higher temporal partitioning was observed between jaguarundi and both ocelot and margay. Lastly, we conducted temporal overlap analysis and calculated species activity levels across study sites to explore if shifts in daily activity within species can be explained by varying levels of local competition pressure. Activity patterns of ocelots, jaguarundis and margays were similarly bimodal across sites, but pumas exhibited irregular activity patterns, most likely as a response to jaguar activity. Activity levels were similar among sites and observed differences were unrelated to competition or intraguild killing risk.

Amur tigers and leopards are recovering across the China-Russia border. However, knowledge is limited about competitive interactions between two large cats in Northeast Asia. Objectives: To assess the spatial, temporal and combined spatiotemporal behavioral mechanisms potentially allow co-occurrence between tigers and leopards in a human-dominated forest landscape. Methods: Based on a large-scale camera-trapping data set in Northeast China, we used three different approaches for quantifying spatiotemporal associations: one spatial method (two-species occupancy model), one strictly temporal method (activity pattern overlap), and one spatiotemporal method based on multi-response permutation procedures at shared camera trap sites. Results: Spatially, leopards showed no avoidance of the areas highly used by dominant tigers, but their diurnal activity pattern was significantly different from that of tigers. Spatiotemporal overlap analysis showed fine-scale behavioral avoidance when both co-occurred at camera locations, which further facilitates sympatry. Tigers spatially overlapped with humans, but they were less active during the day when human activities were more frequent. In areas with high cattle density, low occurrence of tigers and leopards may reflect the absence of sika deer, an important prey item for both species. Conclusions: This study provides the first empirical evidence that tigers do not limit leopard distributions, at least in our study area in Northeast Asia. Our results highlighted temporal segregation, not large-scaled spatial avoidance, as a key mechanism promoting coexistence of two large carnivores.

The ability (or inability) of species to coexist has consequences for diversity and ultimately ecosystem stability. Urbanization is predicted to change species interactions but its relative impact is not well known. Urbanization gradients offer the opportunity to evaluate the effect of humans on species interactions by comparing community dynamics across levels of disturbance. We used camera traps deployed by citizen scientists to survey mammals along urbanization gradients of two cities (Washington, DC and Raleigh, NC, USA). We used a multispecies occupancy model with four competing predator species to test whether forest fragmentation, interspecific interactions, humans or prey had the greatest influence on carnivore distribution. Our study produced 6,413 carnivore detections from 1,260 sites in two cities, sampling both private and public lands. All species used all levels of the urbanization gradient to a similar extent, but co-occurrence of urban-adapted foxes with less urban-adapted bobcats and coyotes was dependent on the availability of green space, especially as urbanization increased. This suggests green space allows less urban-adapted species to occupy suburban areas, but focuses their movements through remaining forest patches, leading to more species interactions. Synthesis and applications. Species interactions, forest fragmentation and human-related covariates were important determinants of carnivore occupancy across a gradient of urbanization with the relative importance of forest fragmentation being highest.

The study of mesopredator interactions is a growing area of research in tropical forests and shedding new light on inter-guild competition between threatened vertebrate species that were previously little understood. Here, we investigate sympatry between the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) and Asiatic golden cat (Pardofelis temminckii) living in the Sumatran rainforests of Indonesia. We investigate: i) spatial overlap of predator-prey species using a combination of single-species occupancy modelling and Bayesian two-species modelling, while controlling for the possible influence of several confounding landscape variables; and, ii) temporal overlap between mesopredators and their shared prey through calculating their kernel density estimate associations. From four study areas, representing lowland, hill, sub-montane and montane forest, 28,404 camera trap nights were sampled. Clouded leopard and golden cat were respectively detected in 24.3% and 22.6% of the 292 sampling sites (camera stations) and co-occurred in 29.6% of the sites where they were detected. Golden cat occupancy was highest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was lowest and conversely lowest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was highest. However, our fine-scale (camera trap site) analyses found no evidence of avoidance between these two felid species. While both mesopredators exhibited highest spatial overlap with the larger-bodied prey species, temporal niche separation was also found. Clouded leopard was more nocturnal and, consequently, had higher temporal overlap with the more nocturnal prey species, such as porcupine and mouse deer, whereas the more diurnal golden cat had higher overlap with the strictly diurnal great argus pheasant. The Bayesian two species occupancy modelling approach applied in our study fills several important knowledge gaps of Sumatra’s lesser known mesopredators and provides a replicable methodology for studying interspecific competition for other small-medium sized carnivore species in the tropics. © 2018 Haidir et al.

We use data from a dense grid of camera traps in a forest in central North Carolina to inform about proximate co-occurrence. Camera trigger times are recorded when animals pass in front of the camera’s field of vision. We view the data as a point pattern over time for each species and model the intensities driving these patterns. These species-specific intensities are modeled jointly in linear time to preserve the notion of co-occurrence. We show that a multivariate log-Gaussian Cox process incorporating both circular and linear time provides a preferred choice for modeling occurrence of forest mammals based on daily activity rhythms. Model inference is obtained under a hierarchical Bayesian framework with an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. After model fitting, we account for imperfect detection of individuals by the camera traps by incorporating species-specific detection probabilities that adjust estimates of occurrence and co-occurrence. We obtain rich inference including assessment of the probability of presence of one species in a particular time interval given presence of another species in the same or adjacent interval, enabling probabilities of proximate co-occurrence.

The main threats are habitat loss and fragmentation from sea-level rise, development, and habitat succession. Exotic predators such as free-ranging domestic cats (Felis catus) pose an additional threat to these endangered small mammals. Management strategies have focused on habitat restoration and exotic predator control. However, the effectiveness of predator removal and the effects of anthropogenic habitat modifications and restoration have not been evaluated. Between 2013 and 2015, we used camera traps to survey marsh rabbits and free-ranging cats at 84 sites in the National Key Deer Refuge, Big Pine Key, Florida, USA. We used dynamic occupancy models to determine factors associated with marsh rabbit occurrence, colonization, extinction, and the co-occurrence of marsh rabbits and cats during a period of predator removal. Rabbit occurrence was positively related to freshwater habitat and patch size, but was negatively related to the number of individual cats detected at each site. Furthermore, marsh rabbit colonization was negatively associated with relative increases in the number of individual cats at each site between survey years. Cat occurrence was negatively associated with increasing distance from human developments. The probability of cat site extinction was positively related to a 2-year trapping effort, indicating that predator removal reduced the cat population. Dynamic co-occurrence models suggested that cats and marsh rabbits co-occur less frequently than expected under random conditions, whereas co-detections were site and survey-specific. Rabbit site extinction and colonization were not strongly conditional on cat presence, but corresponded with a negative association. Our results suggest that while rabbits can colonize and persist at sites where cats occur, it is the number of individual cats at a site that more strongly influences rabbit occupancy and colonization. These findings indicate that continued predator management would likely benefit endangered small mammals as they recolonize restored habitats. © 2018 The Authors.

Even ostensibly benign activities such as hiking or horseback riding in established parks may affect the spatial and temporal activity patterns of wildlife species. Characterization and quantification of effects is essential if parks and other protected areas are to balance the dual needs to nurture an appreciation of wildlands or satisfy a need to encounter nature (sensu the biophilia hypotheses) and to ensure that wild animals can survive and reproduce. We explored how human presence affects wildlife presence in a spatially extensive system of camera traps established in various protected areas in coastal southern California. To characterize and quantify effects we developed a conceptual framework on the basis of joint probabilities of occurrence on a per-camera basis and created a novel statistical approach to assess whether observed probabilities of co-occurrence differed from expected probabilities of co-occurrence. We found that same-day co-occurrence of wildlife and humans was significantly lower than expected at ¿ 90% of the cameras established. This pattern held across sites, across the seven species of large and medium-sized mammals (Bobcat Lynx rufus, Mountain Lion Puma concolor, Gray Fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus, Coyote Canis latrans, Striped Skunk Mephitis mephitis, Northern Raccoon Procyon lotor, and Mule Deer Odocoileis hemionus), and across the five types of human disturbance examined (hikers, bicyclists, domestic dogs, vehicles, and equestrians). Our results demonstrate that human presence acutely affects same-day wildlife detections in protected areas, supporting the hypothesis that avoidance behaviour is a type of “mortality-free predation.” Adaptive and flexible management plans need to be established, evaluated, and updated regularly to facilitate the human nature experience while lessening as much as possible long-term degradation of wildlife habitat. Wildlife in urban-adjacent preserves constitute a major part of the nature experience by humans and require effective management of pressures for use and recreation along aside those for wildlife habitat needs. © 2018 The Authors",2018,"10.1016/j.biocon.2017.12.033","218","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039984989&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2017.12.033&partnerID=40&md5=e778a31aa8c74731addfaaf5d1de603b","Avoidance behavior and Camera trap and Human disturbance and Joint probability and Monte Carlo test and activity pattern and anthropogenic effect and avoidance reaction and coexistence and conceptual framework and conservation management and disturbance and environmental degradation and habitat fragmentation and habitat management and human activity and mammal and Monte Carlo analysis and probability and protected area and reproduction and spatiotemporal analysis and species occurrence and survival and trap (equipment) and wild population and wildlife management and California and United States and Animalia and Canis familiaris and Canis latrans and Lynx rufus and Mammalia and Mephitis and Mephitis mephitis and Odocoileus hemionus and Procyon lotor and Puma concolor and Urocyon and Urocyon cinereoargenteus","233-239",NA,53

Within this context, intraguild competition can limit populations of some species and even play a role in extinction. In this study, we used camera trapping to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of niche partitioning between the African lion Panthera leo leo and the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta in Pendjari Biosphere Reserve, Benin. We found that these predators are more nocturnal in the hunting zone than in the national park of the biosphere reserve. The temporal overlap between lion and hyena was high in the national park (Pianka overlap index 0.88) and low in the hunting zones (0.39). The spatial overlap was low (0.40 in the national park and 0.38 in the hunting zones). The two predators were distributed independently in the national park, but showed significant positive association (co-occurrence) in the hunting zones. We suggest that anthropogenic activities leading to depletion of predators and their prey limit lion and hyena distribution in the hunting zones to some safety areas which are strongly selected by both predators.

Activity patterns are shaped by physiological constraints, evolutionary history, circadian and seasonal changes and may be influenced by other factors, including ecological competition and interspecific interactions. Remote-sensing camera traps allow the collection of species presence data throughout the 24 h period and for almost indefinite lengths of time. Here, we collate data from 10 separate camera trap surveys in order to describe circadian and seasonal activity patterns of 10 mammal species, and, in particular, to evaluate interspecific (dis)associations of five predator-prey pairs. We recorded 8,761 independent detections throughout Northern Ireland. Badgers, foxes, pine martens and wood mice were nocturnal; European and Irish hares and European rabbits were crepuscular; fallow deer and grey and red squirrels were diurnal. All species exhibited significant seasonal variation in activity relative to the timing of sunrise/sunset. Foxes in particular were more crepuscular from spring to autumn and hares more diurnal. Lagged regression analyses of predator-prey activity patterns between foxes and prey (hares, rabbits and wood mice), and pine marten and prey (squirrel and wood mice) revealed significant annual and seasonal cross-correlations. We found synchronised activity patterns between foxes and hares, rabbits and wood mice and pine marten and wood mice, and asynchrony between squirrels and pine martens. Here, we provide fundamental ecological data on endemic, invasive, pest and commercially valuable species in Ireland, as well as those of conservation importance and those that could harbour diseases of economic and/or zoonotic relevance. Our data will be valuable in informing the development of appropriate species-specific methodologies and processes and associated policies.

Given the importance and potential impact of artificial water sources, this study used camera traps to record mammal presence and activity at two artificial water sources in Dana Nature Reserve, Jordan. Seven mammal species, each with distinct activity patterns, were recorded at the water sources, including Nubian ibex, a species of conservation concern.

Using camera-trapping surveys, we explored the site-detection probability of sympatric predators and temporal overlap and examined behavioural patterns to explore hypotheses of carnivore guild interactions between and within large and small predators in the presence/absence of lion (Panthera leo) in open and closed habitat cover. We used single-season two-species occupancy models to test inter-predator interactions at 205 camera sites spread across five Protected Areas of the Maputaland Conservation Unit, South Africa. These data showed the respective associations between the presence of large carnivores and smaller carnivores. We observed that leopard (Panthera pardus) and hyena (Crocuta crocuta) tended to avoid interference encounters, as they were less likely co-detected at the same sites. There was a decrease in detection of leopard and hyena as a function of lion presence. Small predators such as the group honey badger (Mellivora capensis)-striped polecat (Ictonyx striatus) and the slender mongoose (Herpestes sanguineus) were detected less often at cameras where leopards were detected. Detection probabilities of the group badger-polecat and slender mongoose were much higher in the closed habitat than in open habitat where leopards were detected. At camera sites where hyenas were detected, badger-polecat and genet (Genetta tigrina) detection probability was much higher in the closed habitat than open habitat. Slender mongoose overlapped less temporally with large predators while others did not. Our study showed that large predator guilds can affect the probability of detecting subordinate mesopredators; therefore, reintroduction of large carnivores can have a cascading effect on subordinate carnivores, and it is necessary to consider this effect when planning recovery programmes for carnivore conservation. Significance statement: We think this study is of importance and interest as top predators often shape mesopredator communities by inducing apparent avoidance behaviour based on associations between the presence of large carnivores and smaller carnivores. As a consequence, smaller predators use closed habitat to minimize the risk of larger predators due to intraguild interference interaction. We explored behavioural patterns of sympatric predators’ site detection probability and temporal overlap and examined hypotheses about carnivore guild interactions between leopard and spotted hyena, these two and small predators with and without lion in open and closed habitat cover. Reintroduction of one carnivore population can have cascading effects on the other, and this nature of consequences needs to be accounted when planning conservation or species recovery programmes. Therefore, we extended our study to explore these important aspects.

Genetic analysis of material obtained from hair traps with valerian-treated lure sticks confirmed the presence of three wildcat individuals in early 2015. The number of wildcat events detected increased slightly in recent years and wildcats were detected closer to shrub cover and the forest edge. Of the domestic cat events, 90% were within 1.1 km of residential areas, but some moved up to nearly 3 km into the national park. Ranges of wildcats and domestic cats broadly overlapped. All but one camera trap that recorded wildcats also recorded domestic cats, and some camera traps recorded domestic cats but no wildcats. Domestic cats were the fifth most often detected mammal species in the protected area. To avoid a negative impact of domestic cats on wildcats through hybridization, which might already occur, and considering the ecological impact of predation by domestic cats, we recommend a buffer zone of 1 km surrounding the national park, where domestic cats should not be allowed outdoors. © 2017 The Authors.",2017,"10.2981/wlb.00284","2017","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012912077&doi=10.2981%2fwlb.00284&partnerID=40&md5=9dfa8c9a89e77d8c3d1cc0079c117b96",NA,NA,NA,62

Although most of these species are threatened, they are accorded one of the lowest research efforts of all felids, and we lack basic information about them. Many felids occur in sympatry, where intraguild competition is frequent. Therefore, assessing the role of interspecific interactions along with the relative importance of landscape characteristics is necessary to understand how these species co-occur in space. Here, we selected three morphologically similar and closely related species of small Neotropical cats to evaluate the roles of interspecific interactions, geomorphometry, environmental, and anthropogenic landscape characteristics on their habitat use. We collected data with camera trapping and scat sampling in a large protected Atlantic forest remnant (35,000 ha). Throughout occupancy modeling we investigated whether these species occur together more or less frequently than would be expected by chance, while dealing with imperfect detection and incorporating possible habitat preferences into the models. We used occupancy as a measure of their habitat use. Although intraguild competition can be an important determinant of carnivore assemblages, in our system, we did not find evidence that one species affects the habitat use of the other. Evidence suggested that proximity to the nature reserve (a more protected area) was a more important driver of Neotropical spotted cats' occurrence than interspecific interactions or geomorphometry and environmental landscape characteristics-even though our entire study area is under some type of protection.

Over 80% of Atlantic Forest remnants in Brazil are ¡ 50 ha and lack resident populations of large predators (jaguars, Panthera onca, and pumas, Puma concolor). Mesopredators with opportunistic life-history characteristics (e.g., ocelots, Leopardus pardalis) are now hypothesized to be the dominant competitor(s) in these systems and may negatively affect the spatial or temporal distribution of other sympatric mesocarnivores. We used camera-trap data, occupancy models, and temporal overlap indexes to explore whether ocelot occurrence influenced the habitat use or activity patterns of 6 mesocarnivores in reserves of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Ocelot occurrence did not influence the habitat use of these mesocarnivores. Moreover, the ability of some mesocarnivore species, especially the little spotted cat (L. guttulus), to adjust their activity patterns to avoid direct contact with ocelots may facilitate their coexistence in these Atlantic Forest remnants. Ocelot occurrence did not influence the activity pattern of 2 nocturnal species (the crab-eating fox, Cerdocyon thous, and the crab-eating raccoon, Procyon cancrivorus), suggesting that these species are more tolerant of ocelots than other mesocarnivores. The probability of occupancy varied among species, with tayra (Eira barbara) and South American coati (Nasua nasua) having the highest occupancy estimates; overall, occupancy by mesocarnivores correlated negatively with reserve size. Because mesocarnivores are important drivers of ecosystem function, structure, and dynamics and may occupy unique roles that cannot be filled by larger carnivores, future studies should assess environmental factors influencing the use of these small remnants of Atlantic Forest by each mesocarnivore species. © 2016 American Society of Mammalogists.",2016,"10.1093/jmammal/gyw129","97","english","6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042721004&doi=10.1093%2fjmammal%2fgyw129&partnerID=40&md5=cb5dafeedc15d859ced36ba9b134c167","Carnivores and Competition and L. pardalis and Ocelot and Tropical forest and activity pattern and biodiversity and carnivore and coexistence and competition (ecology) and ecological impact and ecological modeling and felid and habitat fragmentation and habitat loss and habitat use and life history and protected area and resident population and species occurrence and sympatry and tropical forest and wild population and Atlantic Forest and Brazil and Dusicyon thous and Eira barbara and Leopardus pardalis and Leopardus tigrinus and Nasua nasua and Panthera onca and Procyon cancrivorus and Puma concolor","1634-1644",NA,64

We investigated interspecific competition between the Endangered tiger and two sympatric carnivore species (Near-Threatened leopard and Endangered dhole) in Malaysia. We used a spatially-explicit camera trapping method to sample the three carnivore species in order to assess their: relative abundance; spatial co-occurrence; and, temporal overlap. Our focal landscape consists of two adjacent study areas that have different forest management regimes: 1) Royal Belum State Park (RBSP) which has relatively higher levels of enforcement resulting in high tiger and prey densities, and 2) Temengor Forest Reserve (TFR) which has no enforcement resulting in low tiger and prey densities. Our analyses found interspecific competition in the form of fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger by leopard in RBSP, but not in TFR. Thus, leopard was less likely to occur in forest patches with greater tiger presence in RBSP. Dhole was not detected in RBSP, and showed no fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger on TRF. It was unclear if absence of dhole in RBSP was due to the high tiger density, or another factor such as disease. Regardless, our results indicate dhole can persist in human-degraded forest landscapes. Neither leopards nor dholes showed any major temporal avoidance of tigers on either site. Our findings of fine-scale spatial avoidance by leopard towards tiger and possible exclusion of dhole by tiger in areas of high tiger density were similar to that found in other areas of Asia. Our study demonstrates that degraded forest can be important for threatened carnivores. It also provides a reminder that efforts to recover tiger populations, a conservation priority, may require flanking measures to secure meso-predator populations, especially those forced into edge environments where they come into greater contact with people. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,"10.1016/j.biocon.2016.11.009","204","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006320939&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2016.11.009&partnerID=40&md5=a5145d3547d2419c07312421573a732b","Interspecific competition and Kernel density estimates and Logging and Occupancy and Panthera and Spatio-temporal avoidance and avoidance reaction and canid and carnivore and endangered species and estimation method and felid and forest management and human activity and interspecific competition and population density and relative abundance and spatiotemporal analysis and species conservation and species occurrence and trapping and Malaysia and Cuon alpinus and Panthera and Panthera pardus","360-366",NA,65

Mesocarnivores are abundant and diverse mid-sized carnivores and can have profound impacts on the function, structure and dynamics of ecosystem after the extirpation of apex predators in many ecosystems. The moist temperate forests of Southwest China harbor a diverse community of mesocarnivores in the absence of apex predators. Sympatric species tend to partition limited resources along time, diet and space to facilitate coexistence. We determined the spatial and temporal patterns for five species of mesocarnivores. We used detection histories from a large camera-trap dataset collected from 2004-2015 with an extensive effort of 23,313 camera-days from 495 camera locations. The five mesocarnivore species included masked palm civet Paguma larvata, leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis, HOG badger Arctonyx collaris, yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, and Siberian weasel Mustela sibirica. Only the masked palm civet and HOG badger tended to avoid each other; while for other pairs of species, they occurred independently of each other, or no clear pattern observed. With regard to seasonal activity, yellow-throated marten was most active in winter, opposite the pattern observed for masked palm civet, leopard cat and HOG badger. For diel activity, masked palm civet, leopard cat and HOG badger were primarily nocturnal and crepuscular; yellow-throated marten was diurnal, and Siberian weasel had no clear pattern for most of the year (March to November), but was nocturnal in the winter (December to February). The seasonal shift of the Siberian weasel may be due to the high diet overlap among species in winter.

These patterns are highly variable across regions and seasons even within the same species. However, quantitative data is still lacking, particularly for sympatric species. We monitored the seasonal and diel activity patterns of terrestrial mammals in Hokkaido, Japan. Through an intensive camera-trap survey a total of 13,279 capture events were recorded from eight mammals over 20,344 camera-trap days, i.e., two years. Diel activity patterns were clearly divided into four categories: diurnal (Eurasian red squirrels), nocturnal (raccoon dogs and raccoons), crepuscular (sika deer and mountain hares), and cathemeral (Japanese martens, red foxes, and brown bears). Some crepuscular and cathemeral mammals shifted activity peaks across seasons. Particularly, sika deer changed peaks from twilight during spring-autumn to day-time in winter, possibly because of thermal constraints. Japanese martens were cathemeral during winter-summer, but nocturnal in autumn. We found no clear indication of predator-prey and competitive interactions, suggesting that animal densities are not very high or temporal niche partitioning is absent among the target species.

Reduced apex predator occupancy or activity can release mesopredators from intraguild competition, with unknown repercussions on the ecological community. As exurban development continues to expand worldwide, it is important to document how mesopredators are impacted by the combined influences of apex predators and humans. We used motion-detecting camera traps to examine spatial and temporal patterns of meso- and apex predator occupancy and activity in a fragmented landscape in California. We hypothesized that both spatial and temporal partitioning among the carnivore guild would be affected by varied levels of human influence. We found that higher residential development reduced puma occupancy but was not related to the occupancy of mesopredators. Bobcats, grey foxes, and Virginia opossums were detected more often at sites occupied by pumas, whereas coyotes and raccoons were detected less often. The detection probabilities of smaller mesopredators were related to coyotes, a dominant mesopredator, but the magnitude and direction of these correlations differed depending upon puma occupancy. We also found that species altered their activities temporally in locations with higher human use, with pumas, bobcats and coyotes reducing diurnal activities and increasing nocturnal ones. These activity shifts were reflected in reduced temporal partitioning between intraguild competitors, with unknown effects on species interactions and repercussions to the prey community. Our results suggest that human development and activity alters predator community structure through both direct and indirect pathways.

These responses relate to trade-offs between foraging and predator avoidance. Following the extirpation of predators from many landscapes, the responses related to predator avoidance may have been lost or diluted. Investigating the activity pattern of prey species on comparable landscapes with and without large predators provides an opportunity to understand how predators may shape prey activity and behaviour. Using camera trap data from neighbouring fenced sections of the Addo Elephant National Park (Eastern Cape, South Africa), we investigated the activity patterns of species exposed to large predators, where the predators were only present in one of the sections. Our results suggest that prey species at risk of predation (e.g., buffalo, kudu and warthog) are more likely to be active diurnally when co-existing with nocturnally active predators, thereby reducing the activity overlap with these predators. In the absence of predators, kudu and buffalo were more active at night resulting in a low overlap in activity between sections. Warthog activity was predominantly diurnal in both sections, resulting in a high overlap in activity between sections. The presence of predators reduced the nocturnal activity of warthogs from 6 to 0.6 % of all warthog captures in each section. Elephants, which are above the preferred prey weight range of the predators and therefore have a low risk of predation, showed higher overlap in activity periodicity between predator-present and predator-absent areas. Our findings suggest that maintaining prey with their predators has the added benefit of conserving the full spectrum of prey adaptive behaviours. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2015,"10.1007/s00265-015-1929-6","69","english","7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930923894&doi=10.1007%2fs00265-015-1929-6&partnerID=40&md5=6a4bcb5a311549f4f2987de9be50a8ef","African buffalo and Diel pattern and Kudu and Lion and Predator–prey interaction and Spotted hyaena and activity pattern and avoidance reaction and coexistence and diel variation and landscape and mammal and predation risk and predator-prey interaction and reintroduction and temporal variation and trade-off and ungulate and videography and Addo Elephant National Park and Eastern Cape and South Africa and Elephantidae and Hyaena and Phacochoerus and Syncerus caffer","1153-1161",NA,71

Many are globally threatened and yet their ecology is poorly understood. We investigated ecological characteristics and spatial and temporal overlap among cats in central Sumatra using data from systematic and opportunistic camera trapping in five major forest blocks. We developed occupancy models assessing probability of site use by each cat based on (1) photo-trap rates of other species at the same locations and (2) landscape-level factors extracted from geographic information systems. We also used two-species co-occurrence models to assess spatial overlap and used kernel density estimates on circular data to assess temporal overlap between species pairs. We photographed five cat species: Sumatran tigers, Sunda clouded leopards, Asiatic golden cats, marbled cats and leopard cats. Four cats were present in all sampling blocks and one sampling block had all five cats. Spatially, cat distributions varied among forest types, within the sampling blocks and across elevation. We placed camera traps at elevations ranging from 6 to 460m above sea level. The five cats used statistically different elevations, with golden cats found at highest elevation. Site use by tigers and leopard cats negatively covaried with distance to protected areas. Clouded leopard presence covaried positively with altitude. Leopard cat presence covaried with the photo-trap rate of tigers, whereas the presence of tigers covaried with the photo-trap rate of non-cat carnivores. We found little evidence of spatial avoidance among cats at camera sites. Temporally, species more similar in size, or with similar-sized prey, had lower overlap, suggesting temporal avoidance.

In predator communities, interspecific interactions are influenced by a diversity of factors; therefore, the behavioural patterns of composing species will differ due to locally adapted interactions. We deployed 32-41 camera-traps in five study areas across the Iberian Peninsula to investigate the temporal relations between mesocarnivores in SW Europe. The selection for a period of the diel cycle and plasticity in activity patterns was evaluated using the Jacobs Selection Index (JSI) and the coefficient of activity overlap (increment1). Furthermore, we investigated whether temporal shifts can facilitate coexistence by reducing activity overlap. Seven species of mesocarnivores were detected and were assigned into one of three behaviourally distinct groups: Diurnal (JSIday ≥ 0.8), strictly nocturnal (JSInight ≥ 0.8) or facultative nocturnal species (0.4 ≥ JSInight &gt; 0.8). Most species exhibited substantial flexibility, which allowed them to locally adapt their foraging strategies (intraspecific increment1 = 0.70-0.77). Mean Δ1 from all interspecific pairwise comparisons was negatively correlated with the number of carnivore species with ≥10 detections (r -0.76, p = 0.02). Our results suggest that temporal segregation is likely to play an important role in facilitating mesocarnivore coexistence, especially with increasing community complexity, where most species' activity peaks were asynchronous.

Few studies have examined communities in which all three components-top predator, intermediate predators, and prey-occur at low densities; such disturbed systems are commonplace in Asia. We tested predictions from intraguild predation theory at a site where low density tigers (top predator), leopards and dholes (intermediate predators) competed for scarce prey. We employed occupancy modeling using sign surveys and camera trapping to investigate prey selection and spatial co-occurrence. Tiger and leopard occupancy matched the availability of their respective prey species, but leopard avoided pigs-a favored prey of tiger. Leopard and dhole had low rates of co-occurrence with tiger, and their detection probabilities were 47-52% lower in tiger-occupied open habitat (compared to closed), despite suitable prey there. Tiger occupancy was highest in prey-rich zones, whereas dholes were concentrated in a prey-poor zone where tigers were scarce, suggestive of mesopredator release. Activity periods of leopard and dhole (diurnal) were significantly different from tiger (nocturnal). In sum, tiger distribution appeared to be driven solely by prey availability, whereas leopard and dhole seemed to be influenced by prey availability and avoidance of tigers, mediated by habitat structure. Results agree with predictions that under intraguild predation the dominant predator's distribution matches its resources, whereas intermediate predators trade-off food and safety. Knowledge of habitat-mediated risk effects could inform recovery efforts for low density tigers facing potential exploitation competition from more numerous leopards and dholes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"10.1016/j.biocon.2012.12.016","163","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879148936&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2012.12.016&partnerID=40&md5=3bbf8ef38662d0e1cd9ddf7d76568d4c","Behavioral ecology and Cuon alpinus and Intraguild predation and Panthera tigris and Risk effects and Trait-mediated interactions and assessment method and avoidance reaction and canid and carnivore and coexistence and competition (ecology) and endangered species and exploitation and felid and forest ecosystem and habitat conservation and habitat structure and intraguild predation and photography and predator-prey interaction and prediction and risk factor and Asia and Cuon alpinus and Felidae and Panthera and Panthera pardus and Panthera tigris and Suidae","68-78",NA,74

Using camera trapping in four Brazilian biomes, we compare the daily activity patterns of the jaguar and puma, and their relationships with their main prey species. We used a kernel density method to quantify daily activity patterns and to investigate overlap between these predators and their main prey. Both cats showed intensive nocturnal and crepuscular activity (0.69 and 0.14 kernel density, respectively, for jaguars; 0.68 and 0.19 kernel density, respectively, for pumas). Only in the Pantanal did we observe a pattern of concentrated diurnal activity for both species. We found little temporal segregation between jaguars and pumas, as they showed similar activity patterns with high coefficients of overlapping (average increment1 = 0.86; SE = 0.15). We also observed a significant overlap between the activity patterns of the predators and their main prey species, suggesting that both predators adjust their activity to reduce their foraging energy expenditure. Our findings suggest that temporal partitioning is probably not a generalized mechanism of coexistence between jaguars and pumas; instead, the partitioning of habitat/space use and food resources may play a larger role in mediating top predator coexistence. Knowledge about these behavior aspects is crucial to elucidating the factors that enable coexistence of jaguars and pumas. Furthermore, an understanding of their respective activity periods is relevant to management and associated research efforts. © 2013 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2013 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",2013,"10.1111/btp.12021","45","english","3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877129013&doi=10.1111%2fbtp.12021&partnerID=40&md5=5925c88f17705e981dc6e0e7302d1e26","Camera trapping and Coefficient of overlapping and Kernel density estimator and Panthera onca and Predator coexistence and Puma concolor and Temporal partitioning and activity pattern and biome and coexistence and felid and Neotropic Ecozone and nocturnal activity and predator and predator-prey interaction and temporal variation and trapping and Brazil and Pantanal and Panthera and Panthera onca and Puma concolor","373-379",NA,75

The occurrence of sympatric large carnivores - tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus and dhole Cuon alpinus - in forests of the Indian subcontinent is complemented with high dietary overlap. We characterized temporal and spatial patterns of large carnivores with major prey species using photo-captures from 50 camera trap stations in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Western Ghats during 2008-2010. We tested whether major prey species' activity and spatial use acted as drivers for coexistence among large carnivores. Tiger exhibited cathemeral activity in the night and is spatially correlated with sambar and gaur, supporting hypotheses related to large-sized prey. Leopard was active throughout the day and is spatially correlated with almost all prey species with no active separation from tiger. Dhole exhibited diurnal activity and spatial use in relation to chital and avoided felids to a certain extent. Leopard exhibited spatial correlation with tiger and dhole, while tiger did not correlate with dhole. Leopard exhibited relatively broader temporal and spatial tolerance due to its generalist nature, which permits opportunistic exploitation of resources. This supports the hypothesis that predators actively used areas at the same time as their principal prey species depending upon their body size and morphological adaptation. We conclude that resource partitioning in large carnivores by activity and spatial use of their principal prey governs spatio-temporal separation in large carnivores. © 2012 The Authors.

Pumas occur sympatrically with jaguars throughout most of the jaguar's range but few studies have investigated space partitioning between both species. Here, camera trapping and occupancy models accounting for imperfect detection were employed in a Bayesian framework to investigate space partitioning between the jaguar and puma in Emas National Park (ENP), central Brazil. Jaguars were estimated to occupy 54.1% and pumas 39.3% of the sample sites. Jaguar occupancy was negatively correlated with distance to water and positively correlated with the amount of dense habitat surrounding the camera trap. Puma occupancy only showed a weak negative correlation with distance to water and with jaguar presence. Both species were less often present at the same site than expected under independent distributions. Jaguars had a significantly higher detection probability at cameras on roads than at off-road locations. For pumas, detection was similar on and off-road. Results indicate that both differences in habitat use and active avoidance shape space partitioning between jaguars and pumas in ENP. Considering its size, the jaguar is likely the competitively dominant of the two species. Owing to its habitat preferences, suitable jaguar habitat outside the park is probably sparse. Consequently, the jaguar population is likely largely confined to the park, while the puma population is known to extend into ENP's surroundings. © 2011 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.",2012,"10.1016/j.mambio.2011.06.011","77","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-83555165070&doi=10.1016%2fj.mambio.2011.06.011&partnerID=40&md5=b84cdc59a75140452732a9e628d80b78","Cerrado and Habitat use and Hierarchical models and Panthera onca and Puma concolor and coexistence and detection method and felid and geographical distribution and habitat type and hierarchical system and niche partitioning and predator and range expansion and range size and space use and sympatry and trapping and Brazil and Emas National Park and Goias and Panthera and Panthera onca and Puma concolor","41-46",NA,78

Human activity can also influence the distribution of wildlife species. In particular, high-human disturbance can displace large carnivore predators, a trait-mediated direct effect. Predator displacement by humans could then indirectly benefit prey species by reducing predation risk, a trait-mediated indirect effect of humans that spatially decouples predators from prey. The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that high-human activity was displacing predators and thus indirectly creating spatial refuge for prey species, helping prey win the ""space race"". We measured the occurrence of eleven large mammal species (including humans and cattle) at 43 camera traps deployed on roads and trails in southwest Alberta, Canada. We tested species co-occurrence at camera sites using hierarchical cluster and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analyses; and tested whether human activity, food and/or habitat influenced predator and prey species counts at camera sites using regression tree analysis. Cluster and NMS analysis indicated that at camera sites humans co-occurred with prey species more than predator species and predator species had relatively low co-occurrence with prey species. Regression tree analysis indicated that prey species were three times more abundant on roads and trails with ¿32 humans/day. However, predators were less abundant on roads and trails that exceeded 18 humans/day. Our results support the hypothesis that high-human activity displaced predators but not prey species, creating spatial refuge from predation. High-human activity on roads and trails (i.e., ¿18 humans/day) has the potential to interfere with predator-prey interactions via trait-mediated direct and indirect effects. We urge scientist and managers to carefully consider and quantify the trait-mediated indirect effects of humans, in addition to direct effects, when assessing human impacts on wildlife and ecosystems. © 2011 Muhly et al.",2011,"10.1371/journal.pone.0017050","6","english","3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952287101&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0017050&partnerID=40&md5=3642a786c0c7f1636d65e318b84a3273","animal behavior and article and Canada and habitat selection and human and human activities and nonhuman and predator avoidance and predator prey interaction and prey selection and quantitative analysis and species coexistence and species habitat and wildlife and animal and cluster analysis and physiology and predation and regression analysis and season and species difference and territoriality and Bos and Mammalia and Animals and Canada and Cluster Analysis and Human Activities and Humans and Predatory Behavior and Regression Analysis and Seasons and Species Specificity and Territoriality",NA,NA,79

Behavioral mechanisms that facilitate species coexistence have been poorly explored and may explain the lack of community-wide morphological character displacement in some carnivore assemblages. We use the results of large-scale and intensive camera-trap surveys conducted in the Atlantic Forest of NE Argentina between 2003 and 2008 to describe the spatial patterns of detection and the daily pattern of records of the six wild cat species present in the region (jaguar Panthera onca, puma Puma concolor, ocelot Leopardus pardalis, jaguarundi Puma yagouaroundi, margay Leopardus wiedii, and oncilla Leopardus tigrinus). We use these patterns to generate hypotheses about behavioral differences that may facilitate species coexistence. The larger species were more frequently recorded in the better-protected areas, probably as a result of anthropogenic effects (poaching of cats and their prey). Competitive release from ocelots and jaguarundis may explain why the oncilla and the margay showed the opposite pattern. Morphologically similar species had the most contrasting activity patterns: the margay was exclusively nocturnal and the jaguarundi diurnal. The other species were cathemeral, but alternated their peaks of activity in relation to the relative order of their body weights. The contrasting temporal patterns observed and the ability of pumas and oncillas to adjust their activity patterns to local conditions may facilitate the coexistence of these cat species and explain the lack of character displacement in this assemblage. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.",2010,"10.1016/j.actao.2010.04.001","36","english","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954847889&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2010.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=ec267ad6d20392fb8dd0db3af1ef9cf2","Abundance and Camera traps and Character displacement and Competition and Wild cats and abundance and activity pattern and anthropogenic effect and carnivore and character displacement and coexistence and felid and hypothesis testing and interspecific competition and morphology and Neotropical Region and niche partitioning and trap (equipment) and wild population and Argentina and Atlantic Forest and Felidae and Felis silvestris and Herpailurus and Herpailurus yaguarondi and Leopardus pardalis and Leopardus tigrinus and Leopardus wiedii and Panthera and Panthera onca and Puma concolor","403-412",NA,80

To infer the interspecific interactions that allow coexistence, we aimed to compare activity patterns and abundance of hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus leuconotus), hooded skunk (Mephitis macroura), and southern spotted skunk (Spilogale angustifrons) in a tropical dry forest with ecological integrity. We analyzed activity patterns and overlap, and compared the relative abundance index (IAR) of mephitids, between rainy and dry seasons and among species, and used 235 records for C. leuconotus, 39 for M. macroura, and 42 for S. angustifrons from 15 camera-trap stations in Mount Tepetroja, Puebla, from May 1st, 2013 to April 30th, 2020. The three mephitids were active mainly during the nocturnal period, although C. leuconotus showed a unimodal pattern with activity peak around midnight, M. macroura had a bimodal pattern with activity peaks during the crepuscular hours at sunset and sunrise, and S. angustifrons had a unimodal pattern with activity peak around 2:00 a.m. Mean activity of C. leuconotus (µ±SE = 00:42 ± 00:12 h) and M. macroura (01:02 ± 00:33 h) were similar (P = 0.32), and differed from the mean activity of S. angustifrons (01:49 ± 00:23 h, P = 0.02). C. leuconotus had the highest IAR (2.53 to 7.90) and differed from M. macroura (0.44 to 1.21) and S. angustifrons (0.83 to 0.96) in both seasons (P < 0.01).

We assessed the impact of eucalyptus plantations on niche partitioning in a carnivore community consisting of red fox (Vulpes vulpes), badger (Meles meles), and stone marten (Martes foina). Based on data from camera trapping, we evaluated the influence of eucalyptus plantations on species occupancy and detection in single-species and co-occurrence models and on temporal activity. Eucalyptus cover negatively influenced detection probability across all species in both single and co-occurrence models. Stone marten detection decreased with the presence of the other carnivores but red fox detection increased in the presence of badgers.

Occupancy of any one species was not influenced by the presence of any other species. Despite having an effect on the detection and occupancy of all 3 carnivores, eucalyptus plantations had no effect on the interactions within this carnivore community.

We created 216 two-species occupancy models for 27 exotic predator-native species pairings to examine how habitat, exotic predator presence or both, influenced each native species' occupancy and/or detection. We found that native bird and small mammal occupancy and/or detection were strongly related to an exotic predator's presence 52% of the time (i.e. 14 of 27 exotic predator-native species pairings). Six of the 14 species pairings (i.e. 43%) had non-independent co-occurrence patterns, four of which were habitat-mediated. The effect of exotic predator presence on native species' detection was largely negative, depressing native species' detection in seven out of 12 instances (i.e. 58% of the time).

The Asiatic black bear, leopard and the hangul showed no clear pattern. We found highest temporal overlap (Delta(1) = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.54-0.86) between leopard and Asiatic black bear followed by pairs between red fox and leopard cat (Delta(1) = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.72-0.91) and jungle cat (Delta(1) = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.60-0.91).

An understanding of these interactions is important for the successful management and conservation of these species. Novel approaches are needed to understand better the spatial relationships between predators and primates across changing landscapes. We combined photographic surveys of predators and humans with line-transect sampling of lemurs across contiguous and fragmented forests in Madagascar to 1) compare relative activity; 2) estimate probability of occupancy and detection; 3) estimate predator-primate and local people-primate co-occurrence; and 4) assess variables influencing these parameters across contiguous and fragmented forests. In fragmented (compared to contiguous) forest sites endemic predator and lemur activity were lower whereas introduced predator and local people activity were higher. Our two-species interaction occupancy models revealed a higher number of interactions among species across contiguous forest where predator and lemur occupancy were highest. Mouse lemurs show evidence of ""avoidance"" (SIF ¡ 1.0) with all predator species (endemic and introduced) in contiguous forest whereas white-fronted brown lemurs show ""attraction"" (SIF ¿ 1.0) with feral cats and local people in contiguous forest. Feral cats demonstrated the highest number of interactions with lemurs, despite their distribution being limited to only contiguous forest. Distance to forest edge and distance to nearby villages were important in predicting predator occupancy and detection.

The results indicated no evidence of spatial avoidance of solitary predator leopards (Panthera pardus ssp. melas) caused by the presence of social predator dholes (Cuon alpinus), and the data showed that the probability of the occupancy of leopards increases when dholes are present. Within the predator-prey interaction, only dhole and banteng (Bos javanicus) showed a significantly negative spatial interaction. The probability of occupancy of Javan deer increased when dholes and leopards were present; that of the muntjac and the buffalo increased when dholes were present and decreased when leopards were present.

Their inter-specific interactions can further complicate effects on community dynamics as a consequence of infra-guild competition. The capacity for competitive mammalian carnivores to segregate their hunting and activity regimes is in major part a function of their similarity, in terms of body-size and dietary niche; termed the 'niche variation hypothesis'. In this study, we used camera-trapping to investigate infra-guild interactions and spatio-temporal partitioning among five mesocarnivores, the golden jackal (Canis aureus), European badger (Metes meles), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European wildcat (Felis sylvestris) and stone marten (Martes foina), in the Stara Planina Mountains, Bulgaria.

With respect to body size, the three smaller species (fox, wildcat and marten) were active in different time periods than the two larger competitors (jackal and badger) through both the warm and cold season. The more similar the trophic niche between species pairs (particularly relating to rodent consumption), the greater the spatio-temporal partitioning we observed within the pair; however, this adapted to seasonal dietary shifts.

By adapting models for multi-species occupancy analysis, we analyzed trail camera data from 192 trail camera locations in and around Jasper National Park, Canada to estimate grizzly bear and black bear occurrence and intensity of trail use. We documented (a) occurrence of grizzly bears and black bears relative to habitat variables (b) occurrence and intensity of use relative to competing bear species and motorised and non-motorised recreational activity, and (c) temporal overlap in activity patterns among the two bear species and recreationists. Grizzly bears were spatially separated from black bears, selecting higher elevations and locations farther from roads. Both species co-occurred with motorised and non-motorised recreation, however, grizzly bears reduced their intensity of use of sites with motorised recreation present. Black bears showed higher temporal activity overlap with recreational activity than grizzly bears, however differences in bear daily activity patterns between sites with and without motorised and non-motorised recreation were not significant. Reduced intensity of use by grizzly bears of sites where motorised recreation was present is a concern given off-road recreation is becoming increasingly popular in North America, and can negatively influence grizzly bear recovery by reducing foraging opportunities near or on trails. Camera traps and multi-species occurrence models offer non-invasive methods for identifying how habitat use by animals changes relative to sympatric species, including humans.

Remote cameras have great but as yet unrealized potential to uncover patterns arising from predatory, competitive or other interactions that structure animal communities by detecting species that are active at the same sites and recording their behaviours and times of activity. Here, we use multi-season, two-species occupancy models to test for evidence of interactions between introduced (feral cat Felis catus) and native predator (Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii) and predator and small mammal (swamp rat Rattus lutreolus velutinus) combinations at baited camera sites in the cool temperate forests of southern Tasmania. In addition, we investigate the capture rates of swamp rats in traps scented with feral cat and devil faecal odours. We observed that one species could reduce the probability of detecting another at a camera site. In particular, feral cats were detected less frequently at camera sites occupied by devils, whereas patterns of swamp rat detection associated with devils or feral cats varied with study site. Captures of swamp rats were not associated with odours on traps, although fewer captures tended to occur in traps scented with the faecal odour of feral cats. The observation that a native carnivorous marsupial, the Tasmanian devil, can suppress the detectability of an introduced eutherian predator, the feral cat, is consistent with a dominant predator - mesopredator relationship. Such a relationship has important implications for the interaction between feral cats and the lower trophic guilds that form their prey, especially if cat activity increases in places where devil populations are declining. More generally, population estimates derived from devices such as remote cameras need to acknowledge the potential for one species to change the detectability of another, and incorporate this in assessments of numbers and survival.",2013,"10.1371/journal.pone.0059846","8","english","4",NA,"MESOPREDATOR RELEASE and TASMANIAN DEVIL and VULPES-VULPES and COMPETITION and CARNIVORES and POPULATION and RESPONSES and ECOLOGY and HABITAT and COOCCURRENCE",NA,NA,95

Theory predicts three possible equilibria, which parallel increasing resource enrichment: exclusion of the IG predator, stable coexistence, and exclusion of the IG prey. Here, we report on the existence of two concurrent states in a model carnivore system dominated by IGP. Using species occurrence data obtained from randomly distributed remote cameras, we modeled the probabilities of detection and occupancy of the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) and its IG predator, the coyote (Canis latrans), at White Sands National Monument, New Mexico, USA, using a recently developed conditional two-species occupancy model. Kit foxes persisted in habitats of low resource abundance, which could not support coyotes. Coexistence occurred in adjacent habitats of higher resource enrichment, with coyote occupancy strongly correlated with small mammal abundance. The odds of a coyote being present vs. absent in prey-rich habitats was 332:1 (+/- 0.006; SE) whereas the odds of a coyote being present vs. absent in prey-poor habitats was 1:4 (+/- 0.11); thus, coyotes were much more likely to be present in prey-rich habitats. Kit foxes were more frequently photographed in prey-poor habitats avoided by coyotes. The odds of kit foxes being present vs. absent at a site where coyotes were absent was 7.9:1 (+/- 0.082), which was greater than the odds of kit foxes being present vs. absent at a site where coyotes were present (2.2:1 +/- 0.081). These findings indicate that kit foxes avoid coyotes, but that their adaptations to arid conditions enable them to exploit habitats unsuitable for coyotes. Consequently, the primary driver of this spatial separation is the inability of coyotes to use prey-poor habitats, rather than kit fox avoidance of coyotes. Our results reveal the existence of concurrent IGP states within the same ecological community, which is consistent with theoretical predictions, and highlight the power of the conditional two-species occupancy model to illuminate how the abundance of shared prey shapes the competitive dynamic in ecological systems dominated by IGP.",2014,NA,"95","english","11",NA,"Canis latrans and competition and coyote and detection probability and intraguild predation and kit fox and New Mexico and Vulpes macrotis and White Sands National Monument and JOAQUIN KIT FOXES and HOME RANGES and COYOTES and HABITAT and DESERT and COOCCURRENCE and COMMUNITIES and COEXISTENCE and COMPETITION and DYNAMICS","3123",NA,96

Using multi-species occupancy modeling at species-relevant spatial scales, we evaluated the hypothesis that increased wolf occurrence suppresses coyote (C. latrans) occurrence with corresponding increased red fox (Vulpes vulpes) occurrence mediated by land cover edge density, human presence, and temporal partitioning. Remote cameras recorded ¿600,000 images and included 6,370, 10,137, and 4,876 detections of wolves, coyotes, and foxes, respectively. Fox occupancy probability was more than three times as high (0.29) at camera sites where wolves were present, relative to sites wolves were absent (0.09). Pairwise species interactions supported expected size-based dominance patterns among canids and insignificant effects were directionally consistent with reported reduced strength of top-down effects in peripheral wolf range. Increased edge density also increased co-occurrence of coyote and wolves, likely a function of increased prey availability and refugia for coyotes. Though foxes occurred in spatial proximity to wolves, competition was limited by greater temporal partitioning than observed between coyotes and foxes that were spatially segregated. Collectively, our results provide marginal support for the reported trophic cascade among wolves, coyotes, and foxes wherein top-down effects may be reduced near the edge of current wolf distributions.

Tiger reserves in India set an example, where annual camera trap monitoring is conducted for understanding the trends in the tiger population. However, less is known about other co-predators and their prey species that occur in the same area. The fundamental hindrance being the absence of individual pelage pattern within these species (i.e. unique pattern on the body), as well as the absence of species-specific monitoring. As a result, there is a demand in techniques that can avail maximum biodiversity information from the existing monitoring protocols. Here, we conducted camera trapping in Periyar Tiger Reserve to evaluate spatiotemporal overlaps within different carnivores, and between prey-predators. Camera trapping was conducted at high resolution (2 km(2)) for 30 days at 253 locations that yielded 6092 photographs of 18 mammals. Their temporal overlap was estimated using 'overlap' R package, while the spatial association was estimated using 'co-occur' package. Three large-ranging top predators (tiger, leopard and dhole) were found to have activity peaks segregated temporally. Relationship of these predators with their prey species highlighted the role of body sizes, where largest predator (tiger) had higher overlap with large-bodied prey (gaur and sambar), while small-bodied predator (leopard and dhole) overlapped small-bodied prey (barking deer and wild pig). Results highlight the importance of large-sized prey in conserving the tiger densities of this region. However, selectively conserving only large-bodied prey can have repercussions on other sympatric carnivores, who require different body-sized prey species. Our results have implications for all protected areas in the tropical developing countries, which are mostly smaller in area with species-centered conservation agenda.

One of the most explicit manifestations of competitive interactions regards spatial displacement. Its interpretation under a theoretical context provides an important tool to deepen our understanding of biological systems and communities, but also for wildlife management and conservation. We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy models on camera-trapping data from multiple sites in Southwestern Europe (SWE) to investigate competitive interactions within a carnivore guild, and to evaluate how species' ecological traits are shaping coexistence patterns. Seventeen out of 26 pairwise interactions departed from a hypothesis of independent occurrence, with spatial association being twice as frequent as avoidance. Association behaviors were only detected among mesocarnivores, while avoidance mainly involved mesocarnivores avoiding the apex predator (n = 4) and mesocarnivore-only interactions (n = 2). Body mass ratios, defined as the dominant over the subordinate species body mass, revealed an important negative effect ((beta) over cap=-0.38;CI95=-0.81to-0.06) on co-occurrence probability, and support that spatially explicit competitive interactions are mostly expressed by larger species able to dominate over smaller ones, with a threshold in body mass ratios of similar to 4, above which local-scale intraguild coexistence is unlikely. We found a weak relationship between pairwise trophic niche overlap and the probability of coexistence ((beta) over cap=-0.19;CI95=-0.58to0.21), suggesting that competition for feeding resources may not be a key driver of competition, at least at the scale of our analysis. Despite local-scale avoidance, regional-scale coexistence appears to be maintained by the spatial structuring of the competitive environment. We provide evidence that SWE ecosystems consist of spatially structured competitive environments, and propose that coexistence among near-sized species is likely achieved through the interplay of ""facultative"" and ""behavioral"" character displacements.

Using information provided by 842 camera-trap photos and 8175 scats, we studied the factors that favour the coexistence of European badgers (Meles meles). red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and stone martens (Martes foina) in a Mediterranean, agroforestry environment in the Iberian Peninsula. With extensive, simultaneous occupation of the space, and simultaneous activity during a broad time period (basically nocturnal and crepuscular activity patterns), the carnivores displayed different strategies depending on the availability of resources. In summer when plant resources were abundant and easy to access, there was a high overlap in patterns of diet and activity, and the temporal avoidance of the superior competitor allowed joint use of the same plots. In autumn, when there were fewer resources (although still sufficient) that were harder to access, the maintenance of food overlap was compensated for by avoidance and a reduction in overlapping activity. In winter and spring, the differentiation in response behaviour was evident in the partial substitution of plant resources. Differentiation in niche dimensions has been linked to complementarity, the differential needs and capacities of each species, and their biology. Differentiation in response behaviour was compatible with the hierarchical structure of the carnivores: European badger: red fox; stone marten. Knowledge of these factors and mechanisms increases our understanding and can help in the prediction of responses to disturbances. Consequently, it helps to improve management and conservation actions. (C) 2013 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

As with other tropical ecosystems, the major threats to wildlife are habitat loss, hunting and invasive species, of which the feral cat (Felis catus) is considered the most damaging. Our camera-trapping study focused on a terrestrial vertebrate species inventory on Bohol Island and tempo-spatial co-occurrences of feral cats with their prey and competitors. The survey took place in the Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape, and we examined the primary rainforest, its border with agricultural land, and rural areas in the vicinity of villages. Altogether, over 2,885 trap days we captured 30 species of vertebrates-10 mammals (including SUS philippensis), 19 birds and one reptile, Varanus cumingi. We trapped 81.8% of expected vertebrates. Based on the number of events, the most frequent native species was the barred rail (Gallirallus torquatus). The highest overlap in Biel activity between cats arid potential prey was recorded with rodents in rural areas (Delta = 0.62); the lowest was in the same habitat with ground-dwelling birds (Delta = 0.40). Cat activity was not recorded inside the rainforest; in other habitats their diet activity pattern differed. The cats' activity declined in daylight in the proximity of humans, while it peaked at the transition zone between rainforest and fields. Both rodents and ground-dwelling birds exhibited a shift in activity levels between sites where cats were present or absent. Rodents tend to become active by day in cat-free habitats. No cats' temporal response to co-occurrences of civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus and Viverra tangalunga) was found but cats in diel activity avoided domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Our first insight into the ecology of this invasive predator in the Philippines revealed an avoidance of homogeneous primary rainforest and a tendency to forage close to human settlements in heterogeneous habitats.

We investigated whether temporal or dietary segregation plays a significant role in the coexistence of Neotropical small felids. In addition, we examined the role of prey activity in shaping their time use. We compared the activity and diet of four felids (oncilla - Leopardus gutullus, margay - L. wiedii, jaguarundi - Puma yagouaroundi, and ocelot - L. pardalis) using camera trapping and scat surveys (45 sampling sites) in an Atlantic Forest remnant (35,000 ha) in Brazil. Ocelot, margay, and oncilla seem to be generalists and, overall, they consumed mammalian prey species of distinct sizes. As a consequence, we found moderate dietary overlap between all pairs of felids and low between ocelot and the other species. Oncilla and margay seem to be cathemeral, jaguarundi diurnal, and ocelot nocturnal, which resulted in low to moderate temporal overlap between them, potentially decreasing interspecific encounters. Predator-prey temporal overlap seems to be moderate for oncilla, margay, and jaguarundi, but high for ocelot. Our results suggest that time partitioning associated with dietary differences contribute to the coexistence of this Neotropical small-felid assemblage, and that prey activity is a factor shaping their activity pattern, especially for ocelot.

When new species enter existing ecological communities, their effects on fellow guild members are difficult to predict. Competition between species within the same guild can regulate populations and influence community structure, but niche partitioning is a way for sympatric species to coexist through differential use of space, time, and resources. The fisher (Pekania pennanti) is a carnivore species that has recently colonized Southeast Alaska (SEAK), the northern margin of its range. Although currently considered at low density, the fisher has been expanding its distribution in SEAK in recent years and may impact the native SEAK forest carnivore guild through competitive interactions. We examined the potential for competition between fisher, American marten (Martes americana), and ermine (Mustela erminea) in SEAK during the winter of 2018 by investigating patterns of spatial and temporal overlap between the species at both local and landscape scales. Using data collected from remote-sensed habitat features, climate characteristics, species detections from 25 systematic camera stations (50 unique cameras), and single-species occupancy models, we found that fisher occupancy was positively correlated with vegetation height, and detection decreased with increased snow density. Using two-species occupancy models, we found evidence of temporal, rather than spatial, avoidance patterns among the SEAK mustelid species investigated, although our inference was limited by sample size. Fisher, the largest mustelid evaluated, did not exhibit changes in occupancy or detection in the presence of marten or ermine. Likewise, detection and occupancy parameters of the mid-sized marten and small-sized ermine were not affected by the presence of the other mustelids. Instead, analysis of diel activity patterns showed that marten and ermine reduced temporal overlap with fisher, exhibiting less activity during times of peak fisher activity. Overall, these results show that mustelids in SEAK displayed a pattern of hierarchical temporal partitioning during winter, with smaller-bodied mustelids avoiding larger, more dominant mustelids. However, if the fisher population continues to expand its range and abundance in SEAK, species interactions may shift and increase the potential for competition between the fisher, marten, and ermine mustelid guild.",2021,"10.1002/ecs2.3827","12","english","11",NA,"activity pattern and competition and ermine and fisher and marten and mustelid and niche and occupancy and partitioning and Southeast Alaska and temporal and winter and MARTENS MARTES-AMERICANA and ACTIVITY PATTERNS and HABITAT SELECTION and FISHERS and CARNIVORES and OCCUPANCY and PENNANTI and COMPETITION and WOLVES and PREY",NA,NA,108

Temporal activity patterns of species are ecologically important as they expose how species exploit their environments. Using camera traps, we evaluated the temporal activity patterns and temporal overlap for a mammalian carnivore assemblage from Sierra Nanchititla Natural Park, central Mexico. We characterized and compared temporal activity patterns and temporal overlap between species pairs using circular statistics. Temporal overlap was analyzed using three temporal domains (full diel, diurnal, and nocturnal), and null models were used to contrast the empirical assemblage-wide temporal overlap in relation to randomly generated distributions. We found that pair-wise temporal overlap comparisons among species were quite heterogeneous and dependent on the temporal domain used for the analyses. Two major inferences can be derived from pair-wise analyses and the null model: (a) most of the carnivore assemblage show a nocturnal activity pattern in common and (b) most of the pair-wise comparisons indicate temporal segregation among species. The highest temporal overlap at the assemblage-wide level was found when only the nocturnal domain was evaluated and we found coincident temporal activities at the full domain level, independent of the temporal resolution used. Overall, our results suggest that carnivores with distinct trophic and habitat use like the margay (Leopardus wiedii) and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) had temporal overlapping activity patterns to full diel and nocturnal domains, and species with similar trophic and habitat use always presented temporal segregation (gray fox and white-nosed coati, Nasua narica). Finally, species with predator-prey relationships (white-nosed coati and cougar, Puma concolor) showed segregation during the day but overlap at night. Our results indicate that species temporal activity patterns likely change in relation to different interspecific interactions such as predation and competition to allow species coexistence within this carnivore assemblage.",2019,"10.1007/s13364-019-00415-8","64","english","3",NA,"Temporal activity pattern and Carnivore and Overlap and Null model and Temporal segregation and PUMA PUMA-CONCOLOR and ACTIVITY PATTERNS and RELATIVE ABUNDANCE and SIERRA NANCHITITLA and NICHE SEGREGATION and WESTERN-GHATS and PANTHERA-ONCA and FOREST and TIME and MAMMALS","342",NA,110

After accounting for habitat preferences and tolerance to anthropogenic factors, we found that African civets and bushy-tailed mongooses avoid each other spatially and temporally.

In this study, we investigate the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the coexistence of an assemblage of five sympatric felids in Borneo.

At large spatial or temporal scales, this can result in the costly loss of access to resources. However, fine-scale reactive avoidance may minimize the risk of aggressive encounters for subordinate predators while maintaining access to resources, thereby providing a mechanism for coexistence. We investigated fine-scale spatiotemporal avoidance in a guild of African predators characterized by intense interference competition. Vulnerable to food stealing and direct killing, cheetahs are expected to avoid both larger predators; hyenas are expected to avoid lions. We deployed a grid of 225 camera traps across 1,125 km(2) in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to evaluate concurrent patterns of habitat use by lions, hyenas, cheetahs, and their primary prey. We used hurdle models to evaluate whether smaller species avoided areas preferred by larger species, and we used time-to-event models to evaluate fine-scale temporal avoidance in the hours immediately surrounding top predator activity. We found no evidence of long-term displacement of subordinate species, even at fine spatial scales. Instead, hyenas and cheetahs were positively associated with lions except in areas with exceptionally high lion use. Hyenas and lions appeared to actively track each, while cheetahs appear to maintain long-term access to sites with high lion use by actively avoiding those areas just in the hours immediately following lion activity. Our results suggest that cheetahs are able to use patches of preferred habitat by avoiding lions on a moment-to-moment basis. Such fine-scale temporal avoidance is likely to be less costly than long-term avoidance of preferred areas: This may help explain why cheetahs are able to coexist with lions despite high rates of lion-inflicted mortality, and highlights reactive avoidance as a general mechanism for predator coexistence.",2016,"10.1002/ece3.2569","6","english","23",NA,"Acinonyx jubatus and carnivore coexistence and Crocuta crocuta and interference competition and Panthera leo and AFRICAN WILD DOGS and INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION and INTRAGUILD PREDATION and OCCUPANCY MODELS and TROPHIC CASCADES and NATIONAL-PARK and TOP-DOWN and PREY and SERENGETI and WOLVES","8545",NA,115

Owing to their central positions, mid-ranking mammalian carnivores are involved in interactions with numerous species, including competition for resources and instances of killing by higher ranking predators. Lethal interactions can directly influence species' demography. However, the fear of lethal interactions, competition or both may also affect when and where individuals are active (i.e. non-lethal interactions). Although differences in body-size and trophic overlap are known predictors of the frequency of lethal interactions, their influence on non-lethal interactions is uncertain. Through camera trapping, we studied non-lethal interactions between a small mesocarnivore (pine marten), a potential killer and intense competitor (red fox) and a moderate competitor and unlikely killer (Eurasian badger). We determined overlap and differences in their diel activity patterns and the degree of spatial overlap in two seasons with contrasting resource availability. Additionally, we estimated the effect of larger carnivore detection rates on pine marten detection rates. We also compared time intervals between pine marten visits to baited stations in the absence and presence of either or both larger carnivores. Our results are consistent with pine martens distributing their daily activity to maximize overlap with prey and to minimize competition and risk of aggression over the spatial scale. Pine martens also responded to the immediate threat of larger carnivores irrespective of the threat they pose by taking 4-7 days longer to re-visit a station. Small-scale non-lethal interactions such as these may enable pine martens to coexist closely with two larger carnivores, yet it remains uncertain whether their population incurs a demographic cost through restricted access to resources.

The influence of interspecific interactions is particularly widespread within carnivore guilds, where species must balance the trade-off between resource acquisition and potentially costly encounters with intraguild competitors/predators. We tested whether intraguild species activity or resource availability had a stronger influence on the seasonal distributions of 10 carnivore species in northern Botswana. We deployed 132 camera stations across a 330km(2) area during the 2014 dry season and 2015 wet season. For each species and season, we developed occupancy models based on resource availability (i.e. prey, vegetation and water) and on intraguild species (i.e. photographic detection rates of intraguild competitors and predators). We then used k-fold cross-validation to assess the relative predictive ability of each model. Carnivore distributions were generally negatively associated with dense vegetation and contrary to expectations, positively associated with the detection rate of intraguild species. This suggests competitor/predator avoidance did not play a large role in influencing carnivore distributions in northern Botswana, a result that differs from other systems, and might be attributed to differences in habitat, carnivore densities, and prey availability. The predictive ability of our resource availability vs. intraguild species models differed between seasons and among species. Leopard distributions, for example, were best predicted by resource availability during the dry season and by the activity of intraguild species in the wet season. The majority of seasonal distributions were best predicted by intraguild species activity or a combination of both resource availability and intraguild species activity. As environments continually change, studies similar to ours are pertinent as they can be used to monitor distributions of wildlife communities and to better understand the relative importance of the diversity of ecological processes impacting wildlife communities.",2017,"10.1111/jzo.12470","303","english","2",NA,"camera trap and carnivore and community dynamics and intraguild species and occupancy modeling and seasonal distributions and AFRICAN WILD DOGS and COMPETITION and SELECTION and POPULATIONS and COEXISTENCE and PATTERNS and ECOLOGY and PREY and NDVI and FEAR","98",NA,117

In contrast, dog Canis lupus familiaris occupancy was best predicted by wide trails, degraded forest and exotic civets. Our results suggest fosas are capable of traversing degraded landscapes and, in the short term, are resilient to contiguous forest disturbance. However, high occupancy of cats and dogs in the landscape leads to resource competition through prey exploitation and interference, increasing the risk of transmission of potentially fatal diseases.

In this context, we attempted to characterise the kleptoparasitic and predatory tendencies of spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta and lions Panthera leo from photographic data collected across 54 camera trap stations and two dry seasons in Tanzania's Ruaha National Park. We applied four different methods of quantifying spatiotemporal associations, including one strictly temporal approach (activity pattern overlap), one strictly spatial approach (co-occupancy modelling), and two spatiotemporal approaches (co-detection modelling and temporal spacing at shared camera trap sites). We expected a kleptoparasitic relationship between spotted hyaenas and lions to result in a positive spatiotemporal association, and further hypothesised that the association between lions and their favourite prey in Ruaha, the giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis and the zebra Equus quagga, would be stronger than those observed with non-preferred prey species (the impala Aepyceros melampus and the dikdik Madoqua kirkii). Only approaches incorporating both the temporal and spatial components of camera trap data resulted in significant associative patterns. The latter were particularly sensitive to the temporal resolution chosen to define species detections (i.e. occasion length), and only revealed a significant positive association between lion and spotted hyaena detections, as well as a tendency for both species to follow each other at camera trap sites, during the dry season of 2013, but not that of 2014. In both seasons, observed spatiotemporal associations between lions and each of the four herbivore species considered provided no convincing or consistent indications of any predatory preferences.

Using information provided by camera trap photos and scats analysis; we determined daily activities and diets of the three canids. African golden wolves and red foxes shared most of their habitat in the two areas, especially in Sidi Toui National Park, while fennec foxes were restricted to the sandy area in Oued Dekouk Natural Reserve. Based on 729 photos produced by camera trap, we observed that the African golden wolf had a continuous activity through the day and the year, while the red fox and the fennec fox were active also through the year but mainly during twilight. We were able to identify food items from 504 scats, which included fruits, invertebrates, rodents, lagomorphs, birds, reptiles and livestock. Our results showed a significant variation in the diets between the species, seasons and sites. Rodents and livestock represented, respectively, 11.7% and 19.2% of the biomass consumed by the African golden wolf over the year. Both foxes ate invertebrates and rodents with different frequency during the seasons. The trophic niche overlap was very high between the two foxes (O-jk ¿ 0.95) and partial between each fox species and the wolves (O-jk ¡ 0.65). The knowledge of the habitat and the trophic niche overlap of these three carnivores increases our understanding of factors responsible for their coexistence, which may help to improve management and conservation actions.

Research on how leopards respond to human presence and competitors, like other predators, can provide important insights on leopard ecology and conservation in human-dominated regions; however, such research is lacking. Here we used data from field cameras in 2010 and 2011 to examine how human presence, prey, and tigers influence leopard spatiotemporal activity patterns in and around Nepal's Chitwan National Park, part of a global biodiversity hotspot. We found that leopards were adjusting their spatiotemporal activity patterns to both tigers and people, but by different mechanisms. Leopards spatially avoided tigers in 2010, but were generally active at the same times of day that tigers were. Despite pervasive human presence, people on foot and vehicles had no significant effect on leopard detection and space use, but leopard temporal activity was displaced from those periods of time with highest human activity. Temporal displacement from humans was especially pronounced outside the park, where there is a much greater prevalence of natural resource collection by local people. Continuing to evaluate the interconnections among leopards, tigers, prey, and people across different land management regimes is needed to develop robust landscape-scale conservation strategies.

Current approaches for multispecies occupancy modelling are practically limited to two interacting species and often require the assumption of asymmetric interactions. We propose amultispecies occupancymodel that can accommodate two ormore interacting species. 2. We generalize the single-species occupancy model to two or more interacting species by assuming the latent occupancy state is a multivariate Bernoulli random variable. We propose modelling the probability of each potential latent occupancy state with both a multinomial logit and a multinomial probit model and present details of aGibbs sampler for the latter. 3. As an example, we model co-occurrence probabilities of bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a function of human disturbance variables throughout 6 Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. We found evidence for pairwise interactions among most species, and the probability of some pairs of species occupying the same site varied along environmental gradients; for example, occupancy probabilities of coyote and grey fox were independent at sites with little human disturbance, but these two species were more likely to occur together at sites with high human disturbance. 4. Ecological communities are composed of multiple interacting species.

Eastern United States has a long history of human impact, which resulted in an altered carnivore community. Specifically, Ohio presents an interesting case for evaluating the relative roles of interspecific relations and habitat characteristics for shaping the carnivore community, as its carnivore community has a unique dynamics and composition: invasive coyote and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and native bobcat (Lynx rufus), currently recovering and expanding its range, gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) declining at a fast pace, and the generalist raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginian opossum (Diclelphis virginiana). We used 50 camera traps to collect presence/absence data in southeastern Ohio, USA. We hypothesized potential interactions between the six carnivores, and used land cover variables, as well as occupancy probabilities of interacting species, to parameterize to single-species occupancy models. We found that landscape composition at three different scales (500 and 1000 m buffer around camera locations, and 3 x 3 km grid cell) had little effect on species occurrence. We identified strong negative interspecific relations between carnivores, with bobcat occurrence being influenced by presence of coyotes, red fox occurrence by gray foxes, and raccoon occurrence by Virginia possums. While these findings cannot discriminate between habitat partitioning (spatial or temporal) and competition (direct or interference), they lend support to complex dynamics between invasive coyotes and red foxes and recovering (bobcat) and declining (gray fox) native carnivore species. In particular, the negative relation between the apex predator in our system, C. latrans, and L. rufus, raise further questions on whether direct competition from coyotes has the potential to slow bobcat population recovery. In the context of regulated trapping (ongoing for gray fox and potential season for bobcat), a better understanding of the carnivore intraguild relations can inform management and conservation actions targeted at minimizing the impact of competition on at-risk native species from non-native species.",2018,"10.3389/fevo.2018.00078","6","english",NA,NA,"carnivores and habitat relationships and interspecific relations and US Midwest and invasive species and native species and management and conservation and BOBCAT LYNX-RUFUS and MESOPREDATOR RELEASE and CAMERA TRAPS and RED FOX and COYOTES and COEXISTENCE and POPULATIONS and ABUNDANCE and PREDATOR and MARKING",NA,NA,128

We hypothesized temporal segregation by ocelots as the main strategy of reducing direct contact with pumas and humans in Atlantic Forest protected areas. Through a standardized camera trap protocol, we measured the degree of activity overlap between ocelots and pumas and between ocelots and humans using circular statistics. Additionally, we investigated predictor variables that may influence the temporal activity of ocelots. Ocelots and pumas showed nocturnal and cathemeral activity, respectively, whereas humans were diurnal. Although the coefficient of overlap between the activity of ocelots and pumas was high (Delta(1) =0.74), the Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test showed significant dissimilarities between their daily distributions of records (W = 5.86; d.f. = 2; P = 0.05). The coefficient of overlap between the activity of ocelots and humans was low (Delta(4) = 0.32) as also revealed by the Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test (W=179.51; d.f. = 2; P¡0.001). Ocelots enhanced their nocturnal activity in sites where occupancy probability of pumas was high and either in sites with more pasture or near human settlements. Our finding suggests that temporal segregation may be one mechanism adopted by ocelots to allow its coexistence with pumas and humans in Atlantic Forest remnants. However, it is unknown whether temporal segregation per se will be enough to guarantee long-term persistence of ocelots in the current degraded scenario of the Atlantic Forest.

Consequently, the structure of carnivore guilds can be critical to ecosystem patterns. Body size is a crucial influence on intraguild interactions, because it affects access to prey resources, effectiveness in scramble competition, and vulnerability to intraguild predation. Coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) occur sympatrically throughout much of North America and overlap in resource use, indicating potential for interspecific interactions. Although much is known about the autecology of the individual species separately, little is known about factors that facilitate coexistence and how interactions within this guild influence distribution, habitat use, and temporal activity of the smaller carnivores. To assess how habitat autecology and interspecific interactions affect the structure of this widespread carnivore guild, we conducted a large-scale, non-invasive carnivore survey using an occupancy modeling framework. We deployed remote cameras during 3-week surveys to detect carnivores at 1,118 camera locations in 357 2.6-km(2) sections (3-4 cameras/section composing a cluster) in the 16 southernmost counties of Illinois (16,058 km(2)) during January-April, 2008-2010. We characterized microhabitat at each camera location and landscape-level habitat features for each camera cluster. In a multistage approach, we used information-theoretic methods to evaluate competing models for detection, species-specific habitat occupancy, multispecies co-occupancy, and multiseason (colonization and extinction) occupancy dynamics. We developed occupancy models for each species to represent hypothesized effects of anthropogenic features, prey availability, landscape complexity, and vegetative land cover. We quantified temporal activity patterns of each carnivore species based on their frequency of appearance in photographs. Further, we assessed whether smaller carnivores shifted their diel activity patterns in response to the presence of potential competitors. Of the 102,711 photographs of endothermic animals, we recorded photographs of bobcats (n=412 photographs), coyotes (n=1,397), gray foxes (n=546), raccoons (n=40,029), red foxes (n=149), and striped skunks (n=2,467). Bobcats were active primarily during crepuscular periods, and their activity was reduced with precipitation and higher temperatures. The probability of detecting bobcats decreased after a bobcat photograph was recorded, suggesting avoidance of remote cameras after the first encounter. Across southern Illinois, bobcat occupancy at the camera-location and camera-cluster scale (local=0.240.04, camera cluster cluster=0.750.06) was negatively influenced by anthropogenic features and infrastructure. Bobcats had high rates of colonization (¡/mml:mover¿=0.86) and low rates of extinction (E¡/mml:mover¿=0.07), suggesting an expanding population, but agricultural land was less likely to be colonized. Nearly all camera clusters were occupied by coyotes (¡/mml:mover¿cluster=0.95 +/- 0.03). At the local scale, coyote occupancy (¡/mml:mover¿local=0.58 +/- 0.03) was higher in hardwood forest stands with open understories than in other areas. Compared to coyotes, gray foxes occupied a smaller portion of the study area (¡/mml:mover¿local=0.13 +/- 0.01, ¡/mml:mover¿cluster=0. 29 +/- 0.03) at all scales. At the scale of the camera cluster, gray fox occupancy was highest in fragmented areas with high proportions of forest, and positively related to anthropogenic features within 100% home-range buffers. Red foxes occupied a similar proportion of the study area as gray foxes (¡/mml:mover¿local=0.12 +/- 0.02, ¡/mml:mover¿cluster=0.26 +/- 0.04) but were more closely associated with anthropogenic features. Only anthropogenic feature models made up the 90% confidence set at all scales of analysis for red foxes. Extinction probabilities at the scale of the camera cluster were higher for both gray foxes (E¡/mml:mover¿=0.57) and red foxes (E¡/mml:mover¿=0.35) than their colonization rates (gray fox ¡/mml:mover¿=0.16, red fox ¡/mml:mover¿=0.06), suggesting both species may be declining in southern Illinois. Striped skunks occupied a large portion of the study area (¡/mml:mover¿local=0.47 +/- 0.01, ¡/mml:mover¿cluster=0.79 +/- 0.03) and were associated primarily with anthropogenic features. Raccoons were essentially ubiquitous within the study area, being photographed in 99% of camera clusters. We observed little evidence for spatial partitioning based on interspecific interactions, with the exception of the gray fox-coyote pairs, and found that habitat preferences were more important in structuring the carnivore community. Habitat had a stronger influence on the occupancy of foxes than did the presence of bobcats. However, the level of red fox activity was negatively correlated with bobcat activity. Gray fox occupancy and the number of detections within occupied sites were reduced in camera clusters occupied by coyotes but not bobcat occupancy. Overall, gray fox occupancy was highest at camera locations with fewer hardwood and more conifer trees. However, gray foxes were more likely to occupy camera locations in hardwood stands than conifer stands if coyotes were also present indicating that hardwood stands may enhance gray fox-coyote coexistence. The 2 fox species appeared to co-occur with each other at the local scale more frequently than expected based on their individual selection of habitat. Similarly, occupancy of camera location by red foxes was higher when coyotes were present. These positive spatial associations among canids may be a response to locally high prey abundance or unmeasured habitat variables. Activity levels of raccoons, bobcats, and coyotes were all positively correlated. Overall, our co- occurrence and activity models indicate competitor-driven adjustments in space use among members of a carnivore community might be the exception rather than the norm. Nevertheless, although our results indicate that gray foxes and red foxes currently coexist with bobcats and coyotes, their distribution appears to be contracting on our study area. Coexistence of foxes with larger carnivores may be enhanced by temporal partitioning of activity and by habitat features that reduce vulnerability of intraguild predation. For instance, hardwood stands may contain trees with structure that enhances tree-climbing by gray foxes, a behavior that probably facilitates coexistence with coyotes. Efforts to enhance gray fox populations would likely benefit from increasing the amount of mature oak-hickory forest. Additionally, the varying results from different scales of analyses underscore the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in carnivore community studies.

Therefore, we tested species with shared preferences for patterns of spatial co-occurrence and temporal overlap. Fruit availability influenced the distribution of common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), while rodent biomass influenced Asiatic jackal (Canis aureus), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), but only during annual periods of scarcity. In contrast, small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was highly selective for a specific habitat (dry dipterocarp forest) regardless of seasonal fluctuations in food availability. Occupancy increased for all species during periods of resource scarcity, with leopard cat and Asiatic jackal experiencing the greatest increases (139% and 58%, respectively). Species with shared resource and habitat preferences appeared to avoid each other, either spatially or temporally. For example, leopard cat and Asiatic jackal co-occurred spatially less than would be expected, though only when rodents were scarce. Similarly, small Indian civet and small Asian mongoose, which used the same habitat and co-occurred spatially at a rate greater than expected, were active at different times. Our results indicate that seasonal resource fluctuations and interspecific interactions strongly influence the distribution of sympatric small carnivores in a fragmented forest.

Avoidance of dominant competitors along the axes of space and time is a potential mechanism for reducing chances of direct encounters between species. However, when resources are essential and spatially fixed, options for spatial partitioning may be limited. We examined resource partitioning within a guild of eight carnivore species at water sources across two commercial farmlands in southwest Namibia. In this semi-desert environment, surface water is scarce and farmers are forced to provision water for livestock through artificial means. Camera traps were used to record spatial and temporal activity patterns of carnivore species at artificial and natural permanent water sources. We found that carnivores use either spatial or temporal resource partitioning, with temporal partitioning being most frequently seen. An association was seen between difference in body mass and degree of spatial partitioning, where species pairings with larger differences in body mass showed the greatest degree of partitioning. These results show that while in arid environments water is rare and used by a number of carnivore species, resource partitioning allows a guild of carnivores, including species of conservation concern, to coexist outside of protected areas.",2015,"10.1111/jzo.12248","297","english","1",NA,"activity pattern and camera trapping and carnivores and partitioning and interspecific competition and Namibia and INTRAGUILD PREDATION and PREY PREFERENCES and DIETARY OVERLAP and NICHE OVERLAP and BODY-SIZE and COMPETITORS and COEXISTENCE and SERENGETI and LANDSCAPE and PATTERNS","31",NA,132

We found five species of wild mammals and two feral ones. All mammals were primarily nocturnal, except for the Rock Squirrel which changes their behavior in comparison with individuals in natural habitats. All wildlife species showed a high temporal overlap of activity with feral fauna particularly, Rock Squirrel, Eastern Cottontail, and Gray Fox. The analysis of spatial co-occurrence showed that the probability of an encounter between species at a certain point of the reservation is random. Although, due to the reduced area of the reserve, species may overlap spatially. In general, our results indicate that feral fauna has a high overlap of activity with wildlife, however, the studied reserve protects wildlife populations.

In 23,373 trap nights, we totaled 21,729 independent records of our focal species. Our results show tendencies toward nocturnality at high land-use intensification, with potential impacts on species fitness. Nocturnal mesocarnivores decreased their diurnal/crepuscular activity, while cathemeral activity shifted to nocturnal activity at high land-use intensification, but only when in sympatry with a competitor. High land-use intensification decreased the activity overlap between native and domestic mesocarnivores but increased the overlap between native mesocarnivores. High intensification also reduced overlap with prey species. Notably, foxes displayed peaks of activity opposing those of dogs, and plasticity in activity pattern when in sympatry with dogs, such as strategies to avoid encounters.

We deployed 57 unbaited camera traps (n = 4923 trap-days) in and around a protected area (Furnas do Bom Jesus State Park, Sao Paulo, Brazil) to survey for tayra and two potentially interactive species: puma (Puma concolor) and free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris). We used encounter histories generated from photographs and occupancy models to quantify tayra landscape use in the human-dominated landscape composed of the protected area that was near a city and surrounded by agricultural lands dominated by small farms. We fit co-occurrence models to understand whether puma and free-ranging dogs affected landscape use by tayra. We detected tayra at 44% of sites and found that tayra landscape use increased with the proportion of forest cover within 500 m of the sampling site. Other factors predicting tayra landscape use included whether the sampling site was within the protected area, its distance to water, and slope. Dogs, which are common on the periphery of the protected area, seem to have a weak negative effect on tayra landscape use. Because of the concentration of forest within the park, this is an important protected area for the carnivore population within this human-modified landscape. Thus, environmental variables, such as forest cover, distance to water, as well as administrative protection status, are important for understanding local-scale tayra distribution.

In this study, we attempted to understand resource partitioning among sympatric carnivores existing in a primary forest with minimal human disturbance in southern Taiwan by camera trapping after the disappearance of the top carnivore, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). Niche relationships were studied in terms of habitat, diet, and time dimensions. Six carnivore species were recorded, but the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus formosanus) was very rare. Canonical correspondence analysis of photographic rates and habitat factors of the other 5 carnivores showed that elevation was the strongest factor explaining the composition of the carnivore community in the habitat dimension. Carnivores could be divided into 3 groups. The low- to mid-elevation group consisted of the gem-faced palm civet (Paguma larvata taivana) and crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva formosanus) which had contrasting activity patterns and different diets; the mid- to high-elevation group consisted of yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula chrysospila) and Siberian weasel (Mustela sibirica taivana).

The study was conducted in a protected area (province of Ourense, north-west Spain), which covers 6700 ha. To test the sympatry hypothesis, 90 fresh faecal samples, identified as faeces of genus Martes on the basis of their morphology, were collected from June 2004 to August 2006. The specific identification of faecal samples was conducted using polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques. In addition, 20 camera-traps (916 camera-trap-nights) were in operation during the study period. Of the faecal samples collected, 88.8% were attributed to the European pine marten, while the remaining 11.2% were not amplified by PCR and thus could not be assigned.

The oncillas were primarily nocturnal in the absence of other larger cat species - margay, ocelot and puma - but became more diurnal, with a cathemeral activity pattern, when the other cats were present.

This ecological process has been well documented in human-modified small areas, but for management and conservation of ecological communities, it is important to know which human factors affect apex predator occurrence and which mediate mesopredators release at large scales. We hypothesized that mesopredators would avoid spatial and temporal overlap with the apex predator, the puma; but that human perturbations (i.e., cattle raising and trophy hunting) would dampen top-down effects and mediate habitat use. We installed 16 camera traps in each of 45, 10 × 10 km grid cells in the Caldén forest region of central Argentina resulting in 706 total stations covering 61,611 km2. We used single-season occupancy and two-species co-occurrence models and calculated the species interaction factor (SIF) to explore the contributions of habitat, biotic, and anthropic variables in explaining co-occurrence between carnivore pairs. We also used kernel density estimation techniques to analyze temporal overlap in activity patterns of the carnivore guild. We found that puma habitat use increased with abundance of large prey and with proximity to protected areas. Geoffroy's cats and skunks spatially avoided pumas and this effect was strong and mediated by distance to protected areas and game reserves, but pumas did not influence pampas fox and pampas cat space use. At medium and low levels of puma occupancy, we found evidence of spatial avoidance between three pairs of mesocarnivores. All predators were mostly nocturnal and crepuscular across seasons and mesopredators showed little consistent evidence of changing activity patterns with varying levels of puma occupancy or human interference. We found potential for mesopredator release at large scale, especially on the spatial niche axis. Our results suggest that a combination of interacting factors, in conjunction with habitat features and intervening human activities, may make mesopredator release unlikely or difficult to discern at broad scales.

The smallest carnivore species, including members of the Mustelidae, are typically the most threatened by other predators but are also exceedingly challenging to study in the wild.

Determining whether this poses a threat to future ecosystem stability necessitates a thorough understanding of mechanisms underpinning community assembly and niche selection. Here, we tested for niche segregation within an African small carnivore community in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We used occupancy modeling based on systematic camera trap surveys and fine-scale habitat measures, to identify opposing preferences between closely related species (cats, genets, and mongooses). We modeled diel activity patterns using kernel density functions and calculated the overlap of activity periods between related species. We also used co-occupancy modeling and activity overlap analyses to test whether African golden cats Caracal aurata influenced the smaller carnivores along the spatial and/or temporal axes. There was some evidence that related species segregated habitat and activity patterns. Specialization was particularly strong among forest species. The cats and genets partitioned habitat, while the mongooses partitioned both habitat and activity period. We found little evidence for interference competition between African golden cats and other small carnivores, although weak interference competition was suggested by lower detection probabilities of some species at stations where African golden cats were present. This suggests that community assembly and coexistence in this ecosystem are primarily driven by more complex processes. The studied carnivore community contains several forest specialists, which are typically more prone to localized extinction. Preserving the observed community assemblage will therefore require the maintenance of a large variety of habitats, with a particular focus on those required by the more specialized carnivores.",2019,"10.1002/ece3.5391","9","english","18","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.5391","occupancy and niche and avoidance and interference and small carnivore and temporal","10092-10108",NA,147

El jaguar y el puma, son los felinos más grandes de América. En esta zona viven simpátricamente por lo que se presupone segregación en alguno de los componentes de su nicho ecológico. En este estudio se analizaron y compararon tres de los componentes principales del nicho: dieta, uso de hábitat y patrones de actividad, con el objetivo de evaluar si existe segregación entre el jaguar y el puma. Para la obtención de los datos se colectaron excrementos de manera oportunista, y se utilizaron trampas de cámaras automáticas en cuatro áreas protegidas. Se analizo la zona de estudio, a través de sistemas de información geográfica para determinar las proporciones de distintos tipos de hábitat presentes, y se colectaron datos de abundancias de las presas. Se analizaron los patrones y en la dieta, en el hábitat utilizado y en el horario de actividad. Se determino que el jaguar tuvo una dieta diferente y mas amplia comparada con la del puma, así también que este consume en promedio, presas más pequeñas. Las presas preferidas por elpuma fueron, tres especies de venados y tepezcuintles. Para el jaguar fueron coches de monte, pizotes y armadillos. Ambas especies presentaron un patrón similar de uso de hábitat, donde el ""bosque alto"" fue utilizado proporcionalmente a su abundancia, y el puma evitó el ""bosque bajo"". En cuanto a los patrones de actividad, ambos prefirieron horas nocturnas para desplazarse, aunque el puma presento mayor variabilidad.

Jaguar and puma are the biggest American wild cats. In this area both live sympatric which suggest segregation in at least one of its ecological niche components. In this study I analyzed and compared three of the principal niche components: diet, habitat use and activity patterns, with the main objective of assess if occurs ecological segregation among jaguar and puma. To obtain the data it was collected  jaguar and puma’s scats in an opportunistic way, and was used automatic camera traps in four protected areas. I analyzed the study area by geographic information system (GIS) to determine proportions of different habitat types, and also I used  previous collected prey abundance data. I analyzed patterns in diet, in habitat use and temporal activity. I found that jaguar had a wider prey spectrum than puma; jaguar took (in average) smallest preys, consequently, diets were significantly different. Puma preferred deer, brocket deer and paca as main prey; in contrast, jaguar preferred collared pecari, coati and armadillo. Both predator species presented a similar pattern in habitat usage, in which ""highland forest"" was used accordingly with its availability and puma avoided ""lowland forest"". About activity patterns, both were more active in the night time, however, puma was more variable in this aspect. Both species did not show segregation spatially or temporally. KEYWORDS: Felidae, Panthera onca, Puma concolor, coexistence, ecologic niche, Mayan forest, ecologic segregation.",2008,"10.22201/ie.20074484e.2008.12.1.48","12","es","1","http://www.revmexmastozoologia.unam.mx/ojs/index.php/rmm/article/view/48",NA,"113-130",NA,148

L. and Woodford, Luke P.","The Journal of Wildlife Management","Estimating population abundances, densities, and interspecific interactions are common goals in wildlife management. Camera traps have been used to estimate the abundance and density of a single species, and are useful for carnivores that occur at low densities. Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models can be used to estimate abundance and density from a camera trap array when all, some, or no individuals in the population can be uniquely identified. These SCR models also estimate locations of individual activity centers, the spatial patterning of which could provide important information about interspecific interactions. We used SCR models to estimate abundances, densities, and activity centers of each of 3 carnivore species (i.e., dingo [Canis familiaris], red fox [Vulpes vulpes], and feral cat) using photographs from 1 camera trap array in southeastern Australia during September to November 2015. Some dingoes and feral cats were uniquely identifiable and therefore, we used a spatial mark–resight model for these species. We could not uniquely identify fox individuals, however, so we used a spatial unmarked (SUN) model for this species. Our estimated dingo density was 0.06/km2. The fox (0.25/km2) and feral cat (0.16/km2) densities are within the ranges previously reported for these species in Australia. We obtained a relatively imprecise fox density estimate because we did not have detections of uniquely identifiable individuals; hence, the SUN model should be used as a last resort. We next modeled spatial dependence among the estimated activity centers for the 3 species using a spatial pair correlation function for a marked point process. Consistent with our expectations, the activity centers of dingoes and foxes were strongly negatively associated at distances of <1,000 m. Foxes and feral cats were also negatively associated at distances of <1,500 m. Surprisingly, dingoes and feral cats were positively associated at distances of >500 m, with no association evident at distances of <500 m. Our study extends the inferences that can be made from using a camera trap array and SCR methods to include spatial patterning and interspecific interactions, and provides new insights into the carnivore community of dingoes, foxes, and feral cats in southeastern Australia. © 2019 The Authors.

Temporal avoidance of interspecific aggression can enable access to resources without spatial exclusion. Apex predators, including humans, can affect mesopredator activity patterns. Human context might also modify temporal interactions between predators. We explored activity patterns, nocturnality and the effects of human activity upon a guild of carnivores (grey wolf, Canis lupus; Eurasian lynx, Lynx lynx; red fox, Vulpes vulpes) using travel routes in Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia. Humans were diurnal, foxes nocturnal and large carnivores active during the night, immediately after sunrise and before sunset. Carnivore activity patterns overlapped greatly and to a similar extent for all pairings. Activity curves followed expectations based on interspecific killing, with activity peaks coinciding where body size differences were small (wolf and lynx) but not when they were intermediate (foxes to large carnivores). Carnivore activity, particularly fox, overlapped much less with that of diurnal humans. Foxes responded to higher large carnivore activity by being more nocturnal. Low light levels likely provide safer conditions by reducing the visual detectability of mesopredators. The nocturnal effect of large carnivores was however moderated and reduced by human activity. This could perhaps be due to temporal shielding or interference with risk cues. Subtle temporal avoidance and nocturnality may enable mesopredators to cope with interspecific aggression at shared spatial resources. Higher human activity moderated the effects of top-down temporal suppression which could consequently affect the trophic interactions of mesopredators.",2020,"10.1007/s00265-020-02831-2","74","en","5","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-02831-2",NA,"62",NA,150

We used camera-trap records of both species obtained at the Iberá Nature Reserve (INR), northeastern Argentina, to test the hypothesis that, when living in sympatry, they reduce competition by using different habitats and by being active at different times. Camera-trap records obtained at 2 additional sites inhabited by only 1 of these species, the Atlantic Forest of Misiones (AF) and Lihué Calel National Park (LCNP), were used to determine the activity patterns of these foxes when living alone. At INR, we set 41 camera-trap stations in 2 habitats (shrubland forest and flooded grassland), and in 2 treatments per habitat (with or without cattle). Three stations also were set in gallery forests. We obtained 540 photographs of crab-eating foxes (289 records) and 175 photographs of pampas foxes (115 records) in 1,521 camera-trap days. At LCNP, 27 camera-trap stations (1,002 camera-trap days) provided 109 records of pampas foxes. At AF, 195 camera-trap stations (11,689 camera-trap days) provided 103 records of crab-eating foxes. At INR, crab-eating foxes were more frequently recorded in forest habitats, whereas pampas foxes preferred opened grasslands. However, both species were found in all habitats and their recording rates were not negatively correlated. At INR, crab-eating foxes were nocturnal, with peaks of activity after dusk and before dawn, a pattern similar to that observed at AF and elsewhere. At INR, pampas foxes showed a peak of activity between 0000 and 0400 h and another between 1000 and 1300 h, a pattern that differed from that observed at LCNP and other places, where the species is mostly nocturnal. At INR, pampas foxes reduced their activity at times when activity of presumably dominant crab-eating foxes was high, which may facilitate their coexistence.",2009,"10.1644/08-MAMM-A-113.1","90","english","2","https://doi.org/10.1644/08-MAMM-A-113.1",NA,"479-490",NA,152

In the case of one of Africa’s most endangered mammals, the riverine rabbit Bunolagus monticularis, only environmental covariates of presence have been used to provide coarse predictions of their distribution. Two potential competitors,namely scrub hare Lepus saxatilis and cape hare L. capensis, have significant (> 90%) range over-lap with the riverine rabbit, yet little is known about how these species interact. We used multi- species occupancy models, which model co-occurrence as a function of environmental variables, to assess the spatial response of riverine rabbits to both species of hare in Sanbona Wildlife Reserve, South Africa. We also examined temporal overlap between riverine rabbits and hares. Camera trapping data were collected from 150 camera traps distributed in clusters of 5 cameras at 30 independent sites, covering 223.24 km 2. Contrary to prior studies, we found that riverine rab-bits were not restricted to riparian habitat, and that their occurrence was conditional on hare absence and was negatively affected by terrain ruggedness. Whilst hare occurrence was inde-pendent of terrain ruggedness, it was negatively affected by rabbit presence. Activity patterns revealed high temporal overlap between hares and rabbits (Δ= 0.828, CI = 0.745−0.940); however, neither species co-occurred at any given site.

In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance, however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human, meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in interspecific competition in other niche dimensions. Further research would benefit from using controlled experimental designs and investigating multiple dimensions of niche partitioning simultaneously. Finally, we recommend complementing the coefficient of temporal overlap with other metrics of fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions.",2022,"10.1111/mam.12265","52","en","1","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mam.12265","activity patterns and coexistence and Carnivora and competition and temporal overlap and Didelphimorphia and temporal niche partitioning","67-81",NA,155

Las fotografías independientes de cada especie se agruparon en tres categorías temporales (día, noche y crepúsculo) y en seis categorías espaciales (tipo de vegetación) para el uso del hábitat; Bosque de Encino, Bosque de Pino Encino, Bosque de Encino Pino, Bosque Mesófilo de Montaña, Selva Baja Caducifolia y Selva Mediana. El solapamiento entre especies (o interacciones) temporales y espaciales se obtuvieron con el índice de Czekanowski y el índice de Pianka, respectivamente. Estos índices son simétricos y toman valores de cero a uno, donde los resultados cercanos a cero indican que no hay solapamiento entre especies y los valores cercanos o con valor de uno indican solapamiento. Se obtuvieron un total de 379 fotografías independientes, de las cuales 239 correspondieron al margay, 118 a ocelote y 22 para el yaguarundi.

We tested whether jaguars are the dominant species in this unique ecosystem, where: (1) pumas outnumber jaguars, (2) pumas are better adapted to arid environments, and (3) jaguars and pumas are of similar size. We analyzed four years of data with two approaches; a two species conditional occupancy model and an activity patterns analysis. We used camera location and prey presence as covariates for jaguar and puma detection and presence probabilities. We also explored overlap in activities of predators and prey. Where both species were detected, peccary presence was positively correlated with both jaguar and puma presence, whereas in areas where jaguars were detected but pumas were not, deer presence explained the probability of jaguar presence. We found that both predators were more likely to co-occur together than to be found independently, and so we rejected the hypothesis that jaguars were the dominant species in our study area.

However, these interactions may change geographically along species’ distribution ranges. The pine marten ( Martes martes ) and stone marten ( Martes foina ) are 2 similar-sized mustelids with overlapping ecological traits and a wide distribution overlap. The absence of stone martens from potentially adequate areas has been advocated as resulting from competitive exclusion by pine martens. Particularly, the preference of both species for mammalian rodents could be the main driver of such competitive stress. However, their elusive behavior and morphological similarity of their scats often precluded the evaluation of their ecological traits in areas of co-occurrence. Using camera trapping and diet analysis on genetically identified scats, we evaluated the interactions between pine and stone martens in the southwestern limit of their range along 3 ecological niche dimensions: spatial, trophic, and temporal, under a hypothesis of competitive dominance of pine martens. We found no spatial segregation, and that coexistence was facilitated by seasonally adjusted shifts along the trophic and temporal axes. While both species often co-occurred, during the season of low food resources, pine martens exploited the less profitable feeding resource. Moreover, they not only displayed an activity pattern that limited their access to rodents, but also reduced the probabilities of direct encounters with stone martens. We suggest that the dominance position has changed in favor of the stone marten in our study area, probably as a result of habitat quality and range edge effects. These findings support the relative instability of interspecific interactions among similar-sized species, which should be evaluated using multidimensional and site-specific approaches.",2016,"10.1093/jmammal/gyw016","97","english","3","https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-abstract/97/3/928/2459701",NA,"928-939",NA,161

Though intraguild competition and predation can limit the set of species that coexist, most carnivores have traits that decrease the impacts of interspecific competition on fitness, a pattern that promotes coexistence. An increasing human population and demand for natural resources (e.g. farming) has fragmented landscapes, reduced available prey, and elevated rates of conflict. These anthropogenic pressures tend to eliminate large carnivores first, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem function (e.g. mesopredator release). Anthropogenic pressures might also affect mesocarnivores directly, but this hypothesis has received little research attention to date. Here, we used camera surveys to describe spatial and temporal patterns of carnivore occupancy in a mixed-use landscape in Kenya. This landscape included a community conservation area and seasonally occupied human settlement and livestock grazing areas. We detected 21 carnivore species and examined occupancy patterns for the 12 most frequently detected. Differences among species in responses to environmental conditions supported a hypothesis of spatial niche partitioning. Differences in the temporal activity patterns of the apex predators and mesocarnivores supported a hypothesis of temporal niche partitioning. Human land use altered occupancy patterns in 10 of 12 species. Apex predator occupancies were lower in more anthropogenically disturbed areas, but mesocarnivore occupancies were not inversely related to apex predators, contrary to the mesopredator release hypothesis.

In carnivorans, competitive interactions are disproportionately costly to subordinate carnivores who must account for the risk of interspecific killing when foraging. Accordingly, missed opportunity costs for meso-carnivores imposed by risk can benefit the smallest-bodied competitors. However, the extent to which the risk perpetuates into spatial partitioning in hierarchically structured communities remains unknown. To determine how risk-avoidance behaviors shape the space-use of carnivore communities, we studied a simple community of carnivores in northern Patagonia, Argentina: pumas (Puma concolor; an apex carnivore), culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus; a meso-carnivore), and chilla foxes (Lycalopex griseus; a small carnivore). We used multi-species occupancy models to quantify the space use within the carnivore community and giving-up densities to understand the behaviors that structure space use. Notably, we applied an analytical framework that tests whether the actual or perceived risk of predation most strongly influences the space use of subordinate carnivores although accounting for their foraging and vigilance behaviors. We found that there was a dominance hierarchy from the apex carnivore through the meso-carnivore to the subordinate small carnivore, which was reflected in space. Although both meso- and small carnivores exhibited similar predator avoidance behavioral responses to apex carnivores, the habitat associations of apex carnivores only altered meso-carnivore space use. The biases in risk management we observed for meso-carnivores likely translates into stable co-existence of this community of competing carnivores.

Los perros domésticos (Canis lupus familiaris) son los carnívoros exóticos más abundantes en el mundo, y a causa de abandono, pueden convertirse en ferales y adoptar un comportamiento salvaje que conlleva a que se vuelvan hábiles competidores por alimento o espacio, provoquen depredación, transmisión de enfermedades y cambios en los patrones de actividad de los mamíferos nativos. Los datos temporales proporcionados por imágenes de cámaras-trampa permiten determinar la segregación de nicho y explicar la coexistencia de las especies y grados de solapamiento. En esta investigación tuve como objetivo identificar el solapamiento ecológico entre cánidos ferales y especies de mamíferos nativos en el suroccidente ecuatoriano mediante la determinación de patrones de actividad y grado de superposición temporal. El estudio lo realicé en tres localidades: Área Nacional de Recreación Isla Santay (ANRIS), Bosque Protector Cerro Blanco (BPCB) y Bosque Petrificado de Puyango (BPP). El método que apliqué fue el fototrampeo, con un tiempo de muestreo que varió en cada localidad. Las especies de mamíferos nativos encontradas las identifiqué mediante la Guía de campo de los mamíferos del Ecuador y la Lista actualizada de especies de mamíferos del Ecuador. Para el análisis de datos, estimé en cada localidad el Índice de Abundancia Relativa (IAR), cálculo que se basó en la consideración de los eventos fotográficos. Los patrones de actividad los describí para especies con eventos superiores o iguales a 11; las fotografías que obtuve la clasifiqué en intervalos de una hora y las agrupé en tres unidades: diurnos, nocturnos y crepusculares; estos análisis lo realicé mediante el programa Oriana, versión 4.0. El solapamiento de nicho temporal lo evalué mediante una función de densidad Kernel y el coeficiente de superposición, que arroja datos entre 0 (sin superposición) y 1 (superposición completa). Usé la prueba de Mardia-Watson-Wheeler para analizar la significancia estadística y categoricé el grado de solapamiento en: bajo (Δ &lt; 0.5), moderado (Δ 0.5 y 0.75) y alto (Δ &gt; 0.75). Los resultados que obtuve indican que los perros ferales estuvieron presentes en las tres localidades de estudio; la abundancia relativa más alta la encontré en el BPCB (IAR = 0.99; n = 30), mientras que en ANRIS y BPP obtuve registros escasos (IAR = 0.32; n = 3; e IAR = 0.64; n = 4, respectivamente). El cánido presentó un patrón de actividad diurno (media = 09:32 h), con un solapamiento temporal moderado y significativo con Nasua nasua, Odocoileus virginianus peruvianus, Dicotyles tajacu y Eira barbara. El solapamiento más alto fue con Dasyprocta punctata (Δ = 0.69), pero no fue estadísticamente significativo. Por otro lado, el perro tuvo solapamiento bajo con las especies nocturnas: Leopardus pardalis, Tamandua mexicana, Sylvilagus daulensis, Procyon cancrivorus, Cuniculus paca y Didelphis marsupialis.

We collected 1,130 photographs of five large- and medium-sized carnivores and 1,541 photographs of 12 small carnivores. Fifty-one percent of records were detected during diurnal period, followed by 38% in nocturnal phase, and 11% during twilight. Small carnivores such as Prionailurus bengalensis and Viverridae spp. were strictly nocturnal, whereas Martes flavigula and Herpestidae spp. were diurnal. Medium-sized carnivores were either nocturnal (Neofelis nebulosa) or diurnal (Cuon alpinus), whereas large-sized carnivores (Panthera tigris, Panthera pardus, and Ursus thibetanus) were cathemeral. A high degree of temporal overlap (>0.75) was found between most sympatric carnivores with distinct activity peaks, while a low overlap (<0.50) was observed between different body-sized carnivores.

We used camera trap data from Tanzania’s Ruaha-Rungwa landscape to explore temporal and spatiotemporal associations between members of an intact East African large carnivore guild, and determine how these varied across gradients of anthropogenic impact and protection. All large carnivores except African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) exhibited predominantly nocturnal road-travel behaviour. Leopard (Panthera pardus) appeared to employ minor temporal avoidance of lion (Panthera leo) in all sites except those where human impacts were highest, suggesting that leopard may have been freed up from avoidance of lion in areas where the dominant competitor was less abundant, or that the need for leopard to avoid humans outweighed the need to avoid sympatric competitors. Lion appeared to modify their activity patterns to avoid humans in the most impacted areas. We also found evidence of avoidance and attraction among large carnivores: lion and spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) followed leopard; leopard avoided lion; spotted hyaena followed lion; and lion avoided spotted hyaena.

We adopted a multi-step approach to systematically incorporate habitat preferences while investigating the co-occurrence of two presumed competitors, morphologically similar, and closely related ground-dwelling birds: the brown tinamou (Crypturellus obsoletus) and the tataupa tinamou (C. tataupa). First, we used single-species occupancy models to identify the main landscape characteristics affecting site occupancy, while accounting for detection probability. We then used these factors to control for the effect of habitat while investigating species co-occurrence. In addition, we investigated species present-time partitioning by measuring the degree of overlap in their activity time. Both species were strictly diurnal and their activity time highly overlapped (i.e., the species are not present-time partitioning). The distribution of the two species varied across the landscape, and they seemed to occupy opposite portions of the study area, but co-occurrence models and species interaction factors suggested that the tinamous have independent occupancy and detection. In addition, co-occurrence models that accounted for habitat performed better than models without habitat covariates. The observed co-occurrence pattern is more likely related to habitat preferences, wherein species segregated by elevation. These results provide evidence that habitat characteristics can play a bigger role than interspecific interactions in regulating co-existence of some species. Therefore, exploring habitat preferences while analyzing co-occurrence patterns is essential, in addition to being a feasible approach to achieve more accurate estimation of parameters reflecting species interactions.

We evaluated factors associated with patterns of occurrence of Andean carnivores in landscapes of the northern Ecuadorian Andes, particularly habitat loss, fragmentation, and occupancy of domestic dogs, and determined whether thresholds occurred for these factors beyond which carnivore occurrence declined markedly. Five study areas (each 20 x 20 km) were surveyed with a total effort of 2,800 camera trap nights. Occupancies of four of the eight carnivores known from the region were best predicted by occupancy of domestic dogs rather than measures of habitat loss and fragmentation [Andean fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus), puma (Puma concolor), striped hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus), and Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus)]. The two largest carnivores, puma and Andean bear, demonstrated significant threshold responses to the presence of domestic dogs at two sites.

Factors determining species occupancy were the presence of wetlands for jaguars (positive effect); water proximity for pumas (positive effect); and presence of pastures for ocelots and jaguarundis (negative effect). Only ocelots were occasionally recorded in oil palm areas. Our results suggest that to align development with the conservation of top predators it is crucial to maintain areas of forest and wetland across agricultural landscapes and to restrict agricultural and oil palm expansion to modified areas such as pastures, which are of limited conservation value. Because there is no spatial segregation between the felid species we studied, conservation strategies that benefit all of them are possible even in modified landscapes.",2020,"10.1017/S0030605318000327","54","en","4","https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/conserving-predators-across-agricultural-landscapes-in-colombia-habitat-use-and-space-partitioning-by-jaguars-pumas-ocelots-and-jaguarundis/C5F24FCE33C86541AA9D16213EC2479B","Panthera onca and Leopardus pardalis and occupancy and Puma concolor and Camera trap and oil palm and object oriented image analysis and Herpailurus yagouaroundi","554-563",NA,176

Species differ in their ability to adapt to humans depending on their degree of specialization in habitat use and feeding habits. This results in asymmetric changes in the ecology of co-occurring species that can influence their interactions. We investigated whether human infrastructures and free-ranging domestic dogs (a species typically associated with humans) influenced the co-occurrence and habitat use of mesocarnivores in a landscape of high human population density in Maharashtra, India. We used 40 camera trap locations during 233 trapping nights and used Bayesian co-occurrence occupancy models to investigate the habitat use and coexistence of species at different spatial scales. Additionally, we investigated their temporal overlap in space use. Indian foxes altered their habitat use both spatially and temporally in order to avoid free-ranging domestic dogs and other larger competitors. The use of human infrastructure by jackals and jungle cats was limited by the presence of dogs. Our results illustrate how habitat use of smaller carnivore species changes both spatially and temporally in order to avoid larger competitors. We also show that the presence of species associated with humans mediates the influence of human infrastructures on the habitat use of mesocarnivores.

J. and Linden, Daniel W. and Anderson, Eric M. and MacFarland, David M.","Ecology and Evolution","Understanding the conditions that facilitate top predator effects upon mesopredators and prey is critical for predicting where these effects will be significant. Intraguild predation (IGP) and the ecology of fear are hypotheses used to describe the effects of top predators upon mesopredators and prey species, but make different assumptions about organismal space use. The IGP hypothesis predicts that mesopredator resource acquisition and risk are positively correlated, creating a fitness deficit. But if shared prey also avoid a top predator, then mesopredators may not have to choose between risk and reward. Prey life history may be a critical predictor of how shared prey respond to predation and may mediate mesopredator suppression. We used hierarchical models of species distribution and abundance to test expectations of IGP using two separate triangular relationships between a large carnivore, smaller intraguild carnivore, and shared mammalian prey with different life histories. Following IGP, we expected that a larger carnivore would suppress a smaller carnivore if the shared prey species did not spatially avoid the large carnivore at broad scales. If prey were fearful over broad scales, we expected less evidence of mesopredator suppression. We tested these theoretical hypotheses using remote camera detections across a large spatial extent. Lagomorphs did not appear to avoid coyotes, and fox detection probability was lower as coyote abundance increased. In contrast, white‐tailed deer appeared to avoid areas of increased wolf use, and coyote detection probability was not reduced at sites where wolves occurred. These findings suggest that mesopredator suppression by larger carnivores may depend upon the behavior of shared prey, specifically the spatial scale at which they perceive risk. We further discuss how extrinsic environmental factors may contribute to mesopredator suppression.",2016,"10.1002/ece3.2170","6",NA,"12","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4865477/",NA,"3884-3897",NA,178

However, inference on behavioral mechanisms are usually lacking. We present an analysis that combines previously published spatial co-occurrence estimates and temporal kernel density estimates to explore spatiotemporal interspecific interactions. We do so by deriving a spatiotemporal value (STV) that is a relative measure of potential interaction in both niche dimensions, across a gradient of degradation, for rainforest carnivore pairs in Madagascar. We also use a conceptual framework to provide insight into the potential behavioral mechanisms of habitat selection. Of the six native and three invasive carnivores, we estimate the spatiotemporal interactions for twelve pairings, which range from no spatial/temporal relationship (n = 5) to spatiotemporal aggregation or segregation (n = 7). We visualized these spatiotemporal interactions along a fragmentation gradient and demonstrate that these interactions are not static, as STV overlap increases with increasing anthropogenic disturbance.

Habitat associations for individual species are well-established, and interactions between particular pairs of species have been highlighted in many focal studies. However, community-wide assessments of the relative strengths of these two factors have not been conducted. We built multi-scale habitat occupancy models for five carnivore taxa of New York’s Adirondack landscape and assessed the relative performance of these models against ones in which co-occurrences of potentially competing carnivore species were also incorporated. Distribution models based on habitat performed well for all species. Black bear (Ursus americanus) and fisher (Martes pennanti) distribution was similar in that occupancy of both species was negatively associated with paved roads. However, black bears were also associated with larger forest fragments and fishers with smaller forest fragments. No models with habitat features were more supported than the null habitat model for raccoons (Procyon lotor). Martens (Martes americana) were most associated with increased terrain ruggedness and elevation. Weasel (Mustela spp.) occupancy increased with the cover of deciduous forest. For most species dyads habitat-only models were more supported than those models with potential competitors incorporated. The exception to this finding was for the smallest carnivore taxa (marten and weasel) where habitat plus coyote abundance models typically performed better than habitat-only models.

Differences in how predators respond to different forms of disturbance might alter their interaction patterns. We sought to understand how human and livestock disturbance impact co-occurrence of sympatric large carnivores such as tiger (Panthera tigris) and leopard (P. pardus) and thereby mediate the intraguild interaction pattern to enable coexistence of the species in a human-dominated landscape. We surveyed 361 locations in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, to examine how prey abundance and disturbance factors such as human and livestock presence might influence habitat use by tigers and leopards independently and when co-occurring. Single-species single-season models and two-species single-season models were developed to examine hypotheses on unconditional detection and occupancy and species interaction respectively. Pervasive human use of the park had negative impacts on tiger occupancy while the abundance of prey had a positive influence. Despite significant prey overlap between tigers and leopards, none of the native prey species predicted leopard habitat occupancy. However, habitats used extensively by livestock were also used by leopards. Further, we found strong evidence of intraguild competition. For instance tiger occupancy was higher in prey-rich areas and leopard occupancy was low in the sites where tigers were present. These findings, and a species interaction factor of < 1 clearly indicate that leopards avoid tigers, but their use of areas of disturbance enables them to persist in fringe habitats. We provide empirical evidence of how intraguild interaction may result in habitat segregation between competing carnivores, while also showing that human and livestock use of the landscape create disturbance patterns that facilitate co-occurrence of the predators. Thus, because large carnivores compete, some disturbance may mediate coexistence in small protected areas.

However, relatively little is known about how urbanization influences competitive interactions among mammalian carnivores, particularly related to wild felids. We evaluated interspecific interactions between medium- and large-sized carnivores across a gradient of urbanization and multiple scales. Specifically, we investigated spatial and temporal interactions of bobcats and pumas by evaluating circadian activity patterns, broad-scale seasonal interactions, and fine-scale daily interactions in wildland–urban interface (WUI), exurban residential development, and wildland habitats. Across levels of urbanization, interspecific interactions were evaluated using two-species and single-species occupancy models with data from motion-activated cameras. As predicted, urbanization increased the opportunity for interspecific interactions between wild felids. Although pumas did not exclude bobcats from areas at broad spatial or temporal scales, bobcats responded behaviorally to the presence of pumas at finer scales, but patterns varied across levels of urbanization. In wildland habitat, bobcats avoided using areas for short temporal periods after a puma visited an area. In contrast, bobcats did not appear to avoid areas that pumas recently visited in landscapes influenced by urbanization (exurban development and WUI habitat). In addition, overlap in circadian activity patterns between bobcats and pumas increased in exurban development compared to wildland habitat. Across study areas, bobcats used sites less frequently as the number of puma photographs increased at a site. Overall, bobcats appear to shape their behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales to reduce encounters with pumas, but residential development can potentially alter these strategies and increase interaction opportunities. We explore three hypotheses to explain our results of how urbanization affected interspecific interactions that consider activity patterns, landscape configuration, and animal scent marking.

We estimated the activity patterns of 3 mesocarnivore species in a semiarid environment in northeastern Brazil: the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), and oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus). We compared the overlap of daily activity among these species and to apex predators. We also estimated nighttime activity of these mesocarnivores during 2 years and compared activity peaks with those of apex predators and potential prey. All 3 mesocarnivores were nocturnal, with ocelots having only 1 record during daytime. Coefficients of overlap with larger predators were high (Δ1 &gt; 0.7) for all pairwise comparisons, since all species were very nocturnal. Nighttime-only activity comparisons (Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests) showed that activity of oncillas differed from that of both larger mesocarnivores and jaguar activity, suggesting temporal segregation. Contrary to our expectations, rodent activity was dissimilar from that of ocelots and crab-eating foxes, but activity of rodents and oncillas was relatively synchronous. Activity of both cat species seems limited to the cooler nighttime, and nocturnal behavior of oncillas more likely reflects activity of potential prey rather than regulation by intraguild predators. Future studies in arid regions should consider climatic factors when estimating activity patterns.Padrões de atividade refletem adaptações às condições físicas e biológicas locais.

Foi comparada a sobreposição da atividade entre estas espécies e com a atividade de predadores de topo. Junto a isso, foi estimada a atividade noturna dos mesocarnívoros durante dois anos de amostragem e foram comparados os picos de atividade destas espécies com predadores de topo e espécies de presas em potencial. Todos os mesocarnívoros foram muito noturnos, com a jaguatirica apresentando apenas um registro durante o período diurno. Isto sugere que o calor intenso do dia pode estar limitando a atividade destas espécies para a noite. Os coeficientes de sobreposição foram altos (Δ1 &gt; 0.7) para todas as comparações entre espécies, devido à maior atividade noturna destes animais.

However, we currently have a poor understanding of the nature of biotic interactions at range edges and how climate may mediate those interactions, particularly for cold-adapted mammals. We studied the distribution of threatened Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) at their southern range edge in northern Washington, United States from 2014 to 2016. Using data collected from 397 camera-trap stations in snow-on and snow-off seasons, and single- and 2-species occupancy models, we investigated seasonal patterns of habitat selection and spatial association of lynx with their primary prey (snowshoe hares, Lepus americanus) and potential competitors (bobcats, Lynx rufus; cougars, Puma concolor). Single-species occupancy models revealed lynx distribution was strongly associated with snowshoe hare abundance and topographic variables related to lower temperatures and increased moisture. In contrast, bobcats and cougars were more generalized in their habitat associations or displayed the reverse response to environmental variables. Spatial overlap of the 3 felid species increased during snow-off seasons. Two-species occupancy models showed a decrease in use of camera sites by lynx when bobcats were present, suggesting lynx were avoiding their warm-adapted competitor.

Large-scale shifts in human activities bestowed both positive and negative impacts on wildlife. Unforeseen reduction in the activities of people allowed wildlife to venture outside of forested areas to exploit newfound habitats and increase their diurnal activities. While on a negative note, a reduction in forest-related law enforcement led to substantial increase in illegal activities such as poaching. We conducted mammal surveys in forested and nearby farmland of a fragmented landscape under two distinct scenarios: pre-lockdown and lockdown. An increase in poaching activities observed during the lockdown period in our study area provided us an opportunity to investigate the impact of the lockdown on wildlife. Camera trapping data of four highly poached mammalian species, namely black-naped hare Lepus nigricollis, wild pig Sus scrofa, four-horned antelope Tetracerus quadricornis and leopard Panthera pardus were considered to investigate activity patterns and habitat use, to understand the effect of lockdown. The pre-lockdown period was used as a baseline to compare any changes in trends of activity patterns, habitat use and detection probabilities of targeted species. Species-specific changes in activity patterns of study species were observed, with an increment in daytime activity during lockdown. The results showed species-specific increase in the habitat use of study species during lockdown. Reduction in the detection probability of all study species was witnessed.

Here, we study how large vertebrates coexist in scavenger assemblages by adapting their diel activity at large ungulate carcasses in NW Spain. We used camera traps to record vertebrate scavengers consuming 34 carcasses of livestock and hunted wild ungulates, which allowed us to assess also differences regarding carcass origin. To evaluate temporal resource partition among species, we estimated the overlap of diel activity patterns and the mean times of each scavenger at carcasses. We recorded 16 species of scavengers, 7 mammals and 9 birds, and found similar richness at both types of carcasses. Birds and mammals showed contrasting diel activity patterns, with birds using carcasses during daytime (mean= 11:38 h) and mammals mostly at night (23:09 h). The unimodal activity patterns of scavengers showed asynchronous peaks among species. Subordinate species modified their activity patterns at carcasses used by apex species to reduce temporal overlap. Also, diel activity patterns of vultures closely followed those of corvids, suggesting facilitation processes in which corvids would enhance carcass detection by vultures. Two mammal species (12.5%) increased nocturnality at carcasses of hunted ungulates, which could be a response to human disturbance. Our results suggest that both temporal segregation and coupling mediate the coexistence of large vertebrates at carcasses. These mechanisms might lead to richer scavenger assemblages and thereby more efficient ones in driving critical ecosystem functions related to carrion consumption, such as energy and nutrient recycling and biodiversity maintenance. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,"10.1016/j.baae.2022.01.008","60","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124750612&doi=10.1016%2fj.baae.2022.01.008&partnerID=40&md5=a9d6bfdc3ee5a480c5047580cf82ab20",NA,"63-75",NA,190

Spatial and temporal niche differentiation are commonly regarded as important mechanisms of coexistence for such carnivores, but how these interactions function and covariation still remains unexplored. We investigated the patterns of coexistence of six sympatric small- and medium-sized carnivores (Mustela kathiah, Melogale moschata, Meles leucurus, Arctonyx collaris, Paguma larvata and Prionailurus bengalensis) in Mayanghe Nature Reserve, Guizhou province, China, by employing camera traps. We used the occupancy models and kernel density estimation to quantify spatial and temporal differentiation respectively, and analyzed the covariation between the resulting indices. We concluded that first spatial and temporal differentiation contributed to coexistence together, but no one of two was significantly dominant. Second, taxonomic relationships did not facilitate differentiation in closely related carnivorous species, but most small- and medium-sized carnivores avoided Prionailurus bengalensis in spatial occupancy. Finally, when the spatial differentiation occurred to a greater extent, the temporal aspects were lessened and vice versa. Our results revealed the patterns and relationship of the spatial and temporal differentiation concerning several sympatric small- and medium-sized carnivores, which can deepen our understanding of niche differentiation and coexistence of sympatric species. © 2022 The Authors",2022,"10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02017","34","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123384754&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2022.e02017&partnerID=40&md5=ead001daaed0e11d6c81032c67fe2c35",NA,NA,NA,191

We used camera traps and remotely sensed data to assess the spatial and temporal relationships between cattle and Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in the Laquipampa Wildlife Refuge, a protected area in northwest Peru where cattle grazing is widespread. Between August 2015 and March 2016, we deployed 122 camera traps at 61 stations to measure the effect of cattle on the distribution and activity of Andean bears during the dry and humid seasons. We used generalized linear models to test the effects of cattle, other anthropogenic disturbances, and natural habitat variation on bear occurrence. We also estimated the degree of overlap between daily activity patterns of bears and cattle. We found a negative association between bears and cattle, and between bears and humans and dogs, and found that bears were less likely to use portions of the park closer to towns and farms. Bear responses to human disturbances were stronger than to habitat variation, and their spatial avoidance of cattle was stronger during the dry season. There was high overlap in daily activity patterns between bears and cattle, and bears and humans and dogs, suggesting the potential for interactions where they co-occur. Given the threatened status of Andean bears, and the role of protected areas in their conservation, we highlight the need for effective management of cattle and associated disturbances to protect this ecologically and culturally important carnivore. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.",2022,"10.1007/s42991-021-00217-z","102","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123924608&doi=10.1007%2fs42991-021-00217-z&partnerID=40&md5=4727670e0890495e3bafca25bce4ab0d",NA,"177-187",NA,192

We used two-species occupancy modeling and temporal analysis to examine fine-scale spatio-temporal overlap between these two species using baited camera traps in three sites in Thailand, including one at the extreme southern end of the black bear’s global range. Probability of occupancy by black bears was 17–22% higher than sun bears in the two northern sites (Khao Yai, Thap Lan), whereas sun bears had 6% higher occupancy in the southern-most site (Khlong Saeng). However, at all sites, occupancy and detectability of sun bear in the presence and absence of black bear were similar, and the species interaction factor was indicative of independent behavior. Sun bears and black bears had similar activity peaks as well, at dusk and dawn, across all sites. However, at the two northern sites, there were small but statistically significant differences, with the morning activity peak of sun bears shifted about two hours after that of black bears. This seemingly slight shift might help sun bears avoid black bears—but it emerges only where sun bears are outnumbered by their larger competitors (and chance of encounter thus particularly high). Our study presents one of the finest-scale investigations (daily occupancy occasions and hourly activity periods) of coexistence of sun bears and black bears and extends our understanding of the remarkably high degree of ecological overlap shared by these two bear species in nature. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.",2022,"10.1007/s42991-021-00201-7","102","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122508757&doi=10.1007%2fs42991-021-00201-7&partnerID=40&md5=234b815e1e2d09bf46ab9571c9654de3",NA,"143-153",NA,193

Due to their high plasticity in behaviour and diet, urban mesocarnivores are ideal species for studying community assembly in novel communities. We analysed the spatial and temporal species interactions of an urban mesocarnivore community composed of the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the marten Martes sp. as native species, the raccoon Procyon lotor as invasive species, and the cat Felis catus as a domestic species in combination with human disturbance modulated by the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown effect that happened while the study was conducted. We analysed camera trap data and applied a joint species distribution model to understand not only the environmental variables influencing the detection of mesocarnivores and their use intensity of environmental features but also the species’ co-occurrences while accounting for environmental variables. We then assessed whether they displayed temporal niche partitioning based on activity analyses, and finally analysed at a smaller temporal scale the time of delay after the detection of another focal species. We found that species were more often detected and displayed a higher use intensity in gardens during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown period, while showing a shorter temporal delay during the same period, meaning a high human-induced spatiotemporal overlap. All three wild species spatially co-occurred within the urban area, with a positive response of raccoons to cats in detection and use intensity, whereas foxes showed a negative trend towards cats. When assessing the temporal partitioning, we found that all wild species showed overlapping nocturnal activities. All species displayed temporal segregation based on temporal delay. According to the temporal delay analyses, cats were the species avoided the most by all wild species. To conclude, we found that although the wild species were positively associated in space, the avoidance occurred at a smaller temporal scale, and human pressure in addition led to high spatiotemporal overlap. Our study sheds light to the complex patterns underlying the interactions in a mesocarnivore community both spatially and temporally, and the exacerbated effect of human pressure on community dynamics. © 2021 The Authors.

In our camera trapping study in a fragmented landscape in south-eastern Australia, a total of ten arboreal and semi-arboreal species were found, with 35,671 independent observations recorded over 6517 camera trap nights. All species were found to be nocturnal; however, a notable number of daytime observations were made for several species (i.e. brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii; sugar glider, Petaurus breviceps; bush rat, Rattus fuscipes; brown rat, Rattus norvegicus). Seasonal variations in diel activity were observed through an increase in crepuscular activity in spring and summer for antechinus, sugar gliders, brown rats, brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula and ringtail possums, Pseudocheirus peregrinus. Diel activity overlap between species was high, that is 26/28 species comparisons had overlap coefficients (Δ) ¿ 0.75. The species pair with the least amount of overlap was between southern bobucks, Trichosurus cunninghami and brown antechinus (Δ4 = 0.66). The species pair with the most overlap was between the native sugar glider and introduced brown rat (Δ4 = 0.93). When comparing the activity of sugar gliders in sites with low and high abundance of brown rats, sugar gliders appear to shift their activity relative to the brown rats. Similarly, behavioural interference was also observed between antechinus and sugar gliders, and when comparing sites of low and high abundance of sugar glider, antechinus had a shift in activity. Our work provides some of the first quantification of temporal patterns for several of the species in this study, and the first for a community of arboreal and semi-arboreal mammals. Our results indicate that some shifts in behaviour are potentially occurring in response to behavioural interference, allowing for coexistence by means of temporal partitioning. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,"10.1007/s42991-021-00218-y",NA,"english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125145956&doi=10.1007%2fs42991-021-00218-y&partnerID=40&md5=9220a451fb93dc93d12750312e4a2c14",NA,NA,NA,195

To support this process, we obtained baseline data on the occurrence of terrestrial mammals in the Nkuba Conservation Area by conducting camera-trap (2014-2018) and transect (2013-2018) surveys. From camera-trap images we also extracted diel activity patterns and estimated overlap in these patterns between selected pairs of species.

The aim of this study is to determine the spatio-temporal structure of a mesocarnivore community in Sant Llorenç del Munt i Serra de l’Obac Natural Park, Catalunya, Spain to investigate the interactions among its species. A total of 36 camera-trapping stations were sampled during two periods of the year: winter–spring (March to April 2019) and summer–autumn (September to October 2019). Four mesocarnivore species were identified: Red fox Vulpes vulpes; Stone marten Martes foina, European badger Meles meles and Common genet Genetta genetta; but due to the low number of detections of the European badger, it was not considered in this study. Spatial overlap was estimated by means of two species occupancy models. Species daily activity pattern was estimated non-parametrically using Kernel density functions (Von-Mise kernel) and temporal overlap was extracted for species pairs. The results indicated that interactions varied depending on the period of the year in terms of spatial overlap. In winter–spring, the species interaction factor (SIF) indicated association within the pairs of fox-genet and marten-genet, while avoidance was reported in fox-marten. In summer–autumn, the most explanatory models were those in which the subordinate species presence was independent from the dominant one. Activity patterns indicated moderate overlap among the species, which showed mostly nocturnal behaviour. Therefore, temporal differentiation may not be the most determining factor in the coexistence mechanism among the community. This work would suggest that the interspecific spatial aggregation or segregation varies throughout the year, without maintaining a clear trade-off relationship with the differences in time use among species, although it should be noted that these conclusions should be taken with care due to the low number of detections that were obtained. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.",2022,"10.1007/s42991-022-00230-w",NA,"english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124752874&doi=10.1007%2fs42991-022-00230-w&partnerID=40&md5=c8f8e08fe3a87122066cc97d13f189bb",NA,NA,NA,198

The occupancy probability for ocelots did not present any habitat preferences based on the covariates used for modeling. Conversely, the landscape variables that best described the occupancy of prey included vegetation structure, land tenure, distance to roads, and to a lesser degree, anthropogenic factors (human and dogs).

However, we currently lack rules for how carnivore communities operate in human-dominated landscapes. We simultaneously quantified overlap in the critical niche axes of a simple carnivore community—an apex carnivore (Puma concolor), a dominant mesocarnivore (Lycalopex cul-paeus), and a subordinate small carnivore (Lycalopex griseus)—in a human landscape featuring pastoralists and semidomestic carnivores (i.e., dogs, Canis familiaris). We found that dominant species had strong negative effects on the space use of subordinate ones, which ultimately created space for subordinate small carnivores. Humans and dogs were strictly diurnal, whereas the native carnivore community was nocturnal and exhibited high temporal overlap. Dietary overlap was high among the native carnivores, but dogs were trophically decoupled, largely because of human food subsidies. Our results show that in landscapes with evident human presence, temporal and dietary partitioning among native carnivores can be limited, leaving space as the most important axis to be partitioned among carnivores. We believe that these findings—the first to simultaneously assess all three critical niche axes among competing carnivores and humans and their associated species (i.e., domesticated carnivores)—are transferable to other carnivore communities in human-modified landscapes. © 2022 The University of Chicago.

Application of occupancy modeling approaches to these datasets typically requires discretizing the dataset to detections over individual days or weeks, which precludes analysis of temporal interactions between species or covariate relationships that change over fine temporal scales. To address this limitation, we developed a two-species occupancy model that assumes a temporal point process detection model. This model permits simultaneous analysis of species interactions in space (i.e., site occupancy) and time (i.e., activity patterns). The model is also capable of estimating the amount of time animals are available for detection, i.e., availability. We applied the model to detections of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and coyote (Canis latrans) collected via camera trapping. We found evidence of both temporal and spatial interactions between deer and coyote. Detection intensity of deer was greater and proportionally more diurnal where coyotes were present. At hunted sites, coyotes were more likely to occur at sites where deer were also present (and vice versa). These results highlight how two-species occupancy models with a continuous-time detection process can be used to infer temporal interactions between species. Our approach broadens the set of questions ecologists can ask regarding both spatial and temporal interactions between species, as well as fine-scale temporal covariates (e.g., weather). Our model should be increasingly applicable given the increasing availability of ecological data collected in continuous time.

The Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul) occurs across central and western Asia with declining populations and the largest population is likely in Mongolia. A potential threat to this felid is livestock encroachment across its range, including within protected areas, yet we lack a clear understanding of the impact of livestock husbandry on this cat. We used motion-sensitive camera data from 216 sites in 4 study areas in western Mongolia to study the occurrence probability of Pallas's cat in relation to habitat characteristics and occurrence of livestock, and conducted a local assessment within a strictly protected area where we obtained the highest number of detections. We estimated a relatively low occupancy (0.33 ± 0.10), which is associated with sites with natural vegetation, steeper slopes, and greater prey abundance. Occupancy also increased with increasing livestock occurrence, particularly large herds of sheep and goats. Such co-occurrence was partially adjusted by diel activity segregation, presumably to limit direct encounters. Our results suggest that the preferred habitat by Pallas's cat in the study region coincides with areas encroached by livestock. The Pallas's cat's habitat is specialized and its dependence on areas that are increasingly used for grazing may eventually threaten the cat with habitat degradation, prey depletion, predation by dogs, and poisoning from pest control. Relevant conservation actions should regulate livestock encroachment within protected areas and improve grazing regimes. The Pallas's cat is an indicator species of mountainous and steppe ecosystems in central Asia; hence, further research towards the preservation of its populations would also benefit other key species across its range. © 2021 The Authors.

As widespread apex predators, humans present a significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain lions Puma concolor to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Mendocino County, California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct, contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for prey.

Using techniques commonly applied to the analysis of interspecific interactions—multispecies occupancy modeling and the analysis of temporal activity patterns—we studied intraspecific interactions within a high-density population of Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor) in Tandoureh National Park, northeastern Iran. Using camera-trap data, we investigated spatiotemporal interactions between male leopards, lone female leopards, and families (cubs/females with cubs). While we hypothesized that male and female leopards would display different temporal activity patterns, we did not predict spatial avoidance between these groups. We also predicted that leopard families would exhibit spatiotemporal avoidance from male leopards due to the risk of infanticide. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find any evidence for spatial or temporal avoidance between leopard families and adult male leopards. Male and lone female leopards exhibited positive pairwise co-occurrence, consistent with reports of high overlap between male and female leopard home ranges. While a high level of overlap in temporal activity patterns was found between males/lone females and males/families, there was evidence for variation in the proportion of time each leopard group was active in particular periods of the diel cycle. Male leopards showed cathemeral activity, while lone females and families were more active during daylight hours. The application of these techniques to interactions within a species has improved understanding of the ecology and behavior of this endangered solitary carnivore. © 2021 The Authors.

We categorized activity patterns of nine carnivore species (one bear, three civets, two felids, one skunk, one mustelid, one linsang) by calculating the photo-capturing proportions at each time period (day, night, twilight). We then evaluated temporal activity overlaps by calculating the overlap coefficients. We identified six nocturnal (three civets, one felid, one skunk, one linsang), two diurnal (one felid, one mustelid), and one cathemeral (bear) species. Temporal activity overlaps were high among the nocturnal species. The two felid species possessing morphological and ecological similarities exhibited clear temporal niche segregation, but the three civet species with similar morphology and ecology did not. Broad dietary breadth may compensate for the high temporal niche overlaps among the nocturnal species. Despite the high species richness of Bornean carnivores, almost half are threatened with extinction.

The extent to which land use intensification affects the presence of native mesocarnivores is largely unexplored, with great implications for all working landscapes where agriculture and native wildlife co-occur. We obtained mesocarnivore detection/non-detection data from 180 4-km2 sampling units in agricultural landscapes of southern Chile from January to April 2019. We used these data to (a) investigate the associations of private land ownership subdivision, forest fragmentation and forest loss with the occurrence of mesocarnivores using single-species occupancy models, (b) assess patterns of mesocarnivore co-occurrence with free-roaming domestic mesocarnivores (e.g. cats and dogs) using two-species occupancy models and (c) determine whether co-occurrence of native and domestic mesocarnivores led to alterations in species’ temporal activity. Land ownership subdivision, rather than habitat loss or fragmentation, had the greatest impact on native mesocarnivore occurrence, with some influence of domestic dogs. Mesocarnivore community occurrence varied from a native to domestic species composition as private land ownership subdivision increased. Native mesocarnivores altered their behaviour temporally when co-occurring with domestics. Lastly, the presence of domestic dogs was associated with an absence of native mesocarnivores, which merits further investigation into the contribution of domestic dogs to a defaunation process in agricultural areas. Policy implications. Our evidence supports focusing efforts in three key dimensions to advance biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. First, private land subdivision represents a robust proxy for measuring anthropogenic impacts on mesocarnivores, and we advocate its use to inform agricultural policy to mitigate a potential defaunation process. Second, there is a need to further engage with landowners and evaluate values, motivation, willingness and action to protect remnant native vegetation and slow land use change. And, lastly, improvements to legislation and conservation marketing strategies on responsible pet ownership are critical to ameliorating the negative impacts of dogs on native wildlife species. © 2021 British Ecological Society",2021,"10.1111/1365-2664.14026","58","english","12","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116037274&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2664.14026&partnerID=40&md5=72d4859d5ed8a915d382fcebc9195cb3","habitat loss and Chile and habitat fragmentation and biodiversity and land use and domestic species and agricultural policy and landownership and Oncifelis guigna","2962-2974",NA,206

Only capybaras showed an apparent change in activity patterns between oil palm plantations and riparian forests, shifting from being crepuscular in forest to predominantly nocturnal inside oil palm plantations. Further, capybaras, giant anteaters and white-tailed deer appeared to modify their activities to avoid human presence inside oil palm plantations by increasing nocturnality (temporal overlap Δ ʳanged from 0.13 to 0.36), whereas jaguarundi had high overlap with human activities [Δ ⁼0.85 (0.61–0.90)].

Using 12 months of camera trap data (21 camera traps, 6722 camera trap days) and phenology on wild and cultivated plant species collected at Caiquene–Cadique, Cantanhez National Park (Guinea-Bissau), we show that humans and chimpanzees broadly overlapped in their use of forest and anthropogenic parts of the habitat including villages and cultivated areas. The spatiotemporal model showed that chimpanzee use of space was predicted by the availability of naturalised oil-palm fruit. Chimpanzees used areas away from villages and agriculture more intensively, but optimised their foraging strategies by increasing their use of village areas with cultivated fruits when wild fruits were scarce.

Survey effort totaled 10 102 camera trap days, with 24 camera trap stations covering an area of approximately 650 km2. Our results showed no significant differences in the habitat preference of the lynx throughout the entire study area or between seasons. The crepuscular and nocturnal activity preferences of the lynx were similar to those of the wolf, red fox, and the European hare. The lynx's daily activity pattern peaked during 20:00-22:00 and 04:00-06:00 hours, and did not show significant variation between seasons. Kernel density estimation was used in order to reveal the temporal overlap of other carnivore and herbivore species with the lynx. The highest temporal overlap (coefficient of overlapping: 0.90) was seen with the European hare. Our findings also indicated higher temporal overlaps with the wolf, red fox, wild boar, and brown bear, and lower overlaps with the red deer, Southwest Asian badger, and Martes spp., which improved understanding of their interactions and co-existence with the lynx. ©",2021,"10.3106/ms2020-0103","46","english","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119124734&doi=10.3106%2fms2020-0103&partnerID=40&md5=355e74ee499e7a05b3e3ace6016d9e26",NA,"285-295",NA,209

Communities with multiple predators that interact and differ in their use of space, time of activity and hunting mode create a complex landscape for prey to avoid predation. Anthropogenic presence and disturbance have the potential to shift interactions among predators and prey and the where and when encounters occur. We examined how white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus fawn spatiotemporal antipredator behaviour differed along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient that had black bears Ursus americanus, coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus and humans present. We quantified (a) spatial co-occurrence in species distributions, (b) temporal overlap across the diel cycle and (c) spatiotemporal associations between humans, bears, coyotes, bobcats, adult male deer and fawns. We also examined how deer vigilance behaviour changed across the anthropogenic disturbance gradient and survey duration. Anthropogenic disturbance influenced spatiotemporal co-occurrence across multiple scales, often increasing spatiotemporal overlap among species. In general, species’ spatial co-occurrence was neutral or positive in anthropogenically disturbed environments. Bears and fawns, coyotes and adult male deer, and bobcats and fawns all had higher temporal overlap in the agriculture-development matrix sites. In addition, factors that influenced deer vigilance (e.g. distance to forest edge and predator relative abundance) in the agriculture-development matrix sites did not in the forest matrix site. By taking into account the different antipredator behaviours that can be detected and the different scales these behaviours might occur, we were able to gain a more comprehensive picture of how humans reduce available niche space for wildlife, creating the neutral and positive spatiotemporal associations between species that studies have been seeing in more disturbed areas. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

These trophic cascades are driven not only by the number of animals they kill, but also by how prey alter their behaviors to reduce risk. The different levels of risk navigated by prey has been likened to a ""landscape of fear.""In Australia, dingoes are known to suppress red fox populations, driving a trophic cascade. However, most of what we know of this relationship comes from circumstances where predators are persecuted, which can affect their social and trophic interactions. Utilizing camera traps, we monitored fox behavior when accessing key resource points used by territorial dingoes, in a region where both predators are protected. We predicted that foxes would avoid and be more cautious in areas of high dingo activity. Indeed, foxes avoided directly encountering dingoes. However, contrary to our expectations, foxes were not more cautious or vigilant where dingo activity was high. In fact, fox activity and scent-marking rates increased where dingo scent-marking was concentrated. Further, foxes were increasingly confident with increasing levels of conspecific activity. Our results suggest that responses to the threat of predation are more complex than fear alone. In socially stable conditions, it is possible that prey may develop knowledge of their predators, facilitating avoidance, and reducing fear. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a key species in Iberian Mediterranean ecosystems. It is the main prey for many vertebrate predators. It is also a game species and is often the target of management measures such as translocations. Aims: To test whether rabbits adjust their activity patterns in response to differing predation regimes in a management context. Methods: Rabbits were translocated from a donor area, with a high rabbit density, to a release area in central Spain, with a semi-permeable fenced plot and an unfenced plot, which had no rabbits before the translocation. We estimated daily activity patterns and relative abundance index (RAI) for mesocarnivores and rabbits by using camera-traps, and calculated Jacobs selection index (JSI) to classify each species in a diel period. Additionally, we calculated the activity overlap between prey and mesocarnivores in the different areas. Key results: Rabbits were nocturnal in the donor area, where only two mesocarnivore species were detected, red fox (Vulpes vulpes, with a high RAI) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon, with a low RAI). However, in the unfenced area, where five mesocarnivore species were present, rabbits showed a crepuscular trend with two activity peaks, around sunrise and around sunset. In contrast, rabbits showed a nocturnal activity in the fenced plot, where four mesocarnivore species were detected but where only the Egyptian mongoose (strictly diurnal) had a high RAI value. Conclusions and implications: The results suggest that rabbits in the fenced plot adapted their activity to avoid the diurnal mongooses. Conversely, rabbits in unfenced areas showed a trend towards day/twilight activity patterns as an adaptation to a diverse community of mesocarnivores. Rabbits can adapt their daily activity patterns to reduce predation risk depending on the pressure exerted by different predator species, with conservation and management implications. These adaptations would allow higher success of rabbit translocations despite the risk of predation by carnivores and could help in the management design of future translocations of this key species. © CSIRO 2021 Open Access CC BY.",2021,"10.1071/WR20156","48","english","6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104025257&doi=10.1071%2fWR20156&partnerID=40&md5=a426ef119741aa07f72fd083b21928ea","activity pattern and predation risk and Vulpes vulpes and Vulpes and Herpestes ichneumon and Herpestidae and Iberian Peninsula and identification key and Oryctolagus cuniculus and Vertebrata","481-490",NA,212

We investigated how European wildcats responded to disturbance from mushroom collectors, cattle and feral pigs in Sicily, Italy. We used detections from 76 cameras over 2 surveys (2015–2016 and 2018; camera days = 1985) to run occupancy and co-occurrence models and estimate overlap in activity patterns between species pairs. During 2015–2016, wildcats were detected at the same location with cattle, mushroom hunters and feral pigs at 14.4%, 26.3% and 17.1% of cameras. During 2018, wildcats were detected at the same location with cattle, mushroom hunters and feral pigs at 7.8%, 19.7% and 6.5% of cameras. Dominant species (A; cattle, mushroom hunters and feral pigs) did not affect occupancy of the subordinate species (B; wildcats) during 2015–2016. In 2018, the effect of species A on wildcat occupancy was evident for cattle-wildcat and mushroom hunters-wildcat pairs and wildcat occupancy was higher at sites where species A was not present. Probabilities of detecting wildcats at sites where species A was not present or not detected were higher than probabilities of detecting wildcats at sites where species A was detected. Overlap in activity levels was low between mushroom hunters and wildcats and higher between cattle and wildcats, but varied between surveys for feral pig-wildcat pair. Although results differed between survey periods, we suggest that wildcats generally avoided cattle, feral pigs and mushroom hunters, at both temporal and spatial scales.

Lethal control of dingoes could therefore potentially exacerbate predation pressure by feral cats on smaller prey species. We monitored the activity of dingoes and feral cats (in the absence of red foxes) in two dingo-baited areas over 16 months using 182 camera traps. First, we estimated population densities across each property and found that dingo and feral cat density were unrelated. Second, we compared daily capture rate of dingo and feral cats and found that both predators' capture rates were weakly related to environmental factors and the baiting program. Third, we analysed temporal overlap in activity of these two predators. Although both predators were nocturnal and showed 78.7% overlap in temporal activity patterns, there was a significant difference in activity peaks. Finally, while both predators were distributed across the whole study site, there was strong temporal separation within 1, 12 and 24 h periods at each individual camera. In conclusion, there was no indication of suppression of feral cat population by dingoes. The large and growing body of similar evidence suggests that calls to restrict dingo control on grounds that it will cause mesopredator releases are unsupported and highly unlikely to yield the biodiversity benefits often hoped for by proponents. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,"10.1016/j.fooweb.2020.e00173","27","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103089971&doi=10.1016%2fj.fooweb.2020.e00173&partnerID=40&md5=0f03db3b367aef864998b051188375a6",NA,NA,NA,214

Understanding species occurrence in areas dominated by nonnative vegetation is important to determine whether management should be implemented. Saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) is one of the most prevalent and invasive nonnative woody species in riparian areas in the southwestern United States, and it can alter vegetation structure. Little is known about how meso (medium) and large carnivores and herbivores use or avoid stands of saltcedar. We investigated mammal activity in 3 riparian forest types along the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona: Nonnative saltcedar, native mesquite (Prosopis spp.) woodland, and native cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and willow (Salix gooddingii) forest. We determined mammal use, diversity, and occupancy across riparian forest types. We sampled mammals along approximately 25 river kilometers between July 2017 and October 2018, using 18 trail cameras (6 per forest type) spaced 1 km apart. We summarized environmental variables around the cameras and reduced the variables to 4 components using a principal component analysis. We observed 14 meso and large mammal species, including bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), and white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) over 7692 trap nights. Occupancy of some species may have been influenced by the environmental components, but models showed high standard errors, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Our results do not indicate that nonnative saltcedar was actively avoided. There were no discernible differences in detections of species or taxonomic groups among forest types; however, the highest species diversity was in mesquite woodlands. We did not find evidence of competitively dominant predators (coyotes and mountain lions [Puma concolor]) altering the temporal activity patterns and forest use of subordinate species (gray fox [Urocyon cinereoargenteus] and bobcat), as each pair used the same riparian space at similar times. © 2021 Brigham Young University.

We studied the potential impacts of human activity (as measured by nonmotorized recreationists) on populations and activity patterns of 12 mammal species, including herbivores and carnivores, from 63 motion-activated cameras that sampled game trails and human trails with varying degrees of human activity along the Front Range of Colorado. Human activity was greatest during the day and minimal or absent during the night. All wildlife species in our study used human trails, although the extent to which human recreation altered the occupancy, relative habitat use, and activity patterns of wildlife varied across species, where some animals appeared to be more influenced by human activity than others. Some species (e.g., fox squirrel, red fox, and striped skunk) did not demonstrate a response to human activity. Other species (e.g., black bear, coyote, and mule deer) altered their activity patterns on recreation trails to be more active at night. Across all wildlife, the degree to which animals altered activity patterns on human trails was related to their natural activity patterns and how active they were during the day when human activity was greatest; species that exhibited greater overlap in natural activity patterns with humans demonstrated the greatest shifts in their activity, often exhibiting increased nocturnal activity. Further, some species (e.g., Abert’s squirrel, bobcat, and mountain lion) exhibited reduced occupancy and/or habitat use in response to human recreation. Managing spatial and temporal refuges for wildlife would likely reduce the impacts of human recreation on animals that use habitat in proximity to trail networks. © 2021 The Authors.",2021,"10.1002/ecs2.3487","12","english","5","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106916673&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.3487&partnerID=40&md5=1e6f8c8d465bef240d5406e35aaae46c",NA,NA,NA,216

Within carnivore guilds, complex hierarchies of dominance facilitate coexistence, whereby subordinate species avoid dominant counterparts by partitioning space, time, or both. We investigated whether a major life history trait (hibernation) in an apex carnivore (black bears Ursus americanus) mediated its top–down effects on the spatio-temporal dynamics of three sympatric mesocarnivore species (coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus, and gray foxes Urocyon cinereoargenteus) across a 15,000 km2 landscape in the western USA. We compared top–down, bottom–up, and environmental effects on these mesocarnivores using an integrated modeling approach. Black bears exerted top–down effects that varied as a function of hibernation and were stronger than bottom–up or environmental impacts. High black bear activity in summer and fall appeared to buffer the most subordinate mesocarnivore (gray foxes) from competition with dominant mesocarnivores (coyotes and bobcats), which were in turn released by black bear hibernation in winter and early spring. The mesocarnivore responses occurred in space (i.e., altered occupancy and site visitation intensity) rather than time (i.e., diel activity patterns unaffected). These results suggest that the spatio-temporal dynamics of mesocarnivores in this system were principally shaped by a spatial predator cascade of interference competition mediated by black bear hibernation. Thus, certain life history traits of apex predators might facilitate coexistence among competing species over broad time scales, with complex implications for lower trophic levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,"10.1007/s00442-021-04927-6","196","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105385793&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-021-04927-6&partnerID=40&md5=0fd1cdde1bc27290ca78bcfdf8ffc472","coexistence and fox and Carnivora and Lynx and Animals and Foxes and Canis latrans and interference competition and climate and Urocyon cinereoargenteus and carnivore and Lynx rufus and bear and animal and predator and spatiotemporal analysis and United States and life history trait and Ursidae and Ursus americanus and ecological modeling and Climate and Urocyon","223-234",NA,217

There was no evidence of strong spatial interactions with other predators. The ecosystem's larger predators (Arabian red fox and honey badger, and all records of wild and feral cats) were primarily associated with the escarpment plateau.

Our research focused on four sympatric carnivores (red fox, Vulpes vulpes; raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides; Japanese marten, Martes melampus; and Asiatic black bear, Ursus thibetanus) living in the forest region of northeastern Japan. From August to November 2019, we obtained data on the activity time for each species from nine infrared-triggered cameras installed along two types of unpaved forest roads with different vehicle frequencies (high or low) and subsequently assessed the effect of vehicle-passing frequencies on activity using kernel density estimation and chi-square test. Red foxes and raccoon dogs were nocturnal on all forest roads; however, their nighttime activities were significantly greater on the forest road with a high vehicle-passing frequency than on the road with a low vehicle-passing frequency. Japanese martens showed a nocturnal pattern on all forest roads, and there was no significant difference in the proportion of nighttime activities between the forest roads. Asiatic black bears were highly active during the daytime on forest roads with a low vehicle-passing frequency, but were highly nocturnal on forest roads with a high vehicle-passing frequency. Our results suggest that human disturbance influences the ratio of daytime to nighttime activity in carnivores; however, the extent and magnitude of this effect are limited. This finding indicates that the spatial scale of effects of human disturbance on the activity of each animal species should be assessed before habitat management programs are implemented. © 2021, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.",2021,"10.1007/s11355-020-00434-7","17","english","2","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098747787&doi=10.1007%2fs11355-020-00434-7&partnerID=40&md5=2268512c6b3961ad478e27ddc3643a57",NA,"225-231",NA,219

Under the situation of global decline of large mammal populations, determining the interspecific interaction and co-existing mechanism between sympatric predators is essential to help us understand the underlying mechanisms driving ecosystem changes and species population dynamics. The spatial and temporal niches are the two most critical dimensions shaping an animal's ecological niche, and the interaction relationship of spatiotemporal niche between sympartric species is the basis to understand species co-existence. In this study, we took the Wolong National Nature Reserve in central Qionglai Mountains, Sichuan Province, as our study area. We collected spatiotemporal data of snow leopard(Panthera uncia, occurrence locations n=198) and red fox(Vulpes vulpes, n=68) from camera-trapping and fecal DNA surveys to construct species distribution models and conduct analysis on their daily activity patterns for both species. The results showed that, the area of overlapped suitable habitats of snow leopard and red fox in the study region was 404.08 km2, which mainly located in the high-altitude area in the northwest part of the reserve, accounting for 77.74% and 80.79% of the total habitat area of snow leopard and red fox respectively. These two species had great overlap on vertical distributions as well and both showed a distribution peak approximately at 4 300 m above sea level, whereas the mean elevation of snow leopard was slightly higher than that of red fox, and the range of red fox's vertical distribution spanned slightly wider than that of snow leopard. The daily activity patterns of snow leopard(number of independent detections n=351) and red fox(n=155) were both bimodal. Snow leopards tended to be crepuscular, while red foxes were more nocturnal, with high level of overlap between the two species(Δ=0.68).At sites where snow leopards were present or where snow leopards had been previously detected within two weeks, red foxes increased their nocturnality, thus reducing the temporal overlap with snow leopards, although their daily activity pattern was not significantly changed. The results of this study preliminarily revealed the spatiotemporal niche relationship between snow leopard and red fox, which will provide examples and basic information for us to better understand the co-existing mechanism of apex predators and meso-predators in alpine ecosystems, and provide supports for the fine management of these carnivore populations in the nature reserves. © 2021, Science Press.

The results showed that the Chinese ferret-badger was a typical nocturnal animal with two peaks in daily activity(01:00-05:00 and 21:00-24:00).The peak of ferret-badger activity during the dry season was earlier and was three hours longer in duration compared with during the rainy season. The crab-eating mongoose was strictly diurnal with a single activity peak(11:00-18:00).Compared to during the rainy season, the dry season activity peak for mongooses occurred earlier and was also longer in duration. The daily activity patterns of both species showed marked difference between seasons. The overlap index between the Chinese ferret-badgers and crab-eating mongooses during the research period was lower(Δ=0.17), and was higher in the dry season(Δ=0.22)than that in the rainy season(Δ=0.12).Therefore, we conclude that sympatric Chinese ferret-badgers and crab-eating mongooses likely decrease interspecific competition by time niche differentiation so as to coexist. © 2021, Science Press.

Many studies have shown that wildlife avoids or reduces direct contact with human activities through changes in activity patterns, and by minimizing spatiotemporal overlap. In this study, we investigated the possible effects of human presence on the temporal activity of medium-to-large mammals using two areas in Myanmar that differ in the intensity of human disturbance. We monitored temporal segregation mechanisms using camera trapping data and with two statistical approaches: daily activity overlaps between humans and wildlife and circular statistics. We did not find a significant difference in overlapping activity between areas but, thanks to circular statistics, we found that some species show changes in activity patterns, suggesting temporal avoidance. We observed that the daily activity of five species differed between areas of Myanmar, likely adopting mechanisms to reduce overlap in areas highly frequented by humans. Interestingly, these species are all threatened by hunting or poaching activities, four of which have been described in literature as “cathemeral”, or species that are active through day and night. This study suggests that some species adapt their behavior, at least partially, to avoid human presence in habitats with higher anthropic occurrence and increase our knowledge on the status of medium–large mammals in a poorly studied country as Myanmar. © 2021 by the authors.

However, spatio-temporal patterns of indirect interactions as promoters of pathogen transfer between domestic and wild canids are largely unknown. In this study, we used camera traps to describe the activity patterns and habitat use of dogs, chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) foxes and identify the local-scale factors that may affect the frequency of dog-fox interactions through an anthropization gradient of the Coquimbo region, Chile. We assessed local-scale variables that may predict the number of interactions between dogs and foxes, and compared the time interval between dog-culpeo and dog-chilla interactions. Our findings suggested that closeness to urbanized zones predicts the frequency of indirect interactions between dogs and foxes. We found higher number of dog-fox interactions (60 interactions) at a periurban site adjacent to two coastal towns (Tongoy and Guanaqueros), compared to other two more undisturbed sites (12 interactions) increasingly distanced from urbanized areas. We showed that dogs interacted more frequently with chilla foxes (57 interactions) than with culpeo foxes (15 interactions), and the first interaction type occurred almost exclusively at the periurban site, where dogs and chillas were more frequently detected than in the other sites. We detected a marked temporal segregation between dogs and foxes, but dog-chilla interactions resulted in shorter time intervals (2.5 median days) compared to dog-culpeo interactions (7.6 median days), suggesting a higher potential risk of pathogen spillover between the first species pairing. Based on previous studies, we suggest periurban zones may constitute a potential focus of pathogen exposure between dog and fox populations in the study area. Our research contributes to improving the knowledge on the spatio-temporal patterns of interspecific contact between invasive and native carnivores within the context of multi-host pathogen dynamics. Our outcomes will inform theoretical epidemiological models designed to predict and minimize the contact risk between domestic and threatened species, guiding effective control strategies at the wildlife-domestic interface. © Copyright © 2021 Hernández, Manqui, Mejías and Acosta-Jamett.",2021,"10.3389/fvets.2021.631788","8","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101272593&doi=10.3389%2ffvets.2021.631788&partnerID=40&md5=74483a2fa613f756b8e003c28e71f309","fox and habitat use and Chile and endangered species and wildlife and Article and nonhuman and animal behavior and dog and spatiotemporal analysis and controlled study and animal experiment and city and clinical assessment and comparative study and control strategy and epidemiological data and host pathogen interaction and infectious agent and intimacy and organismal interaction and pathogen transmission and rain and risk assessment and risk factor and rural area and species identification and urban area and urbanization and wildlife conservation",NA,NA,223

Based on the data acquired from Herpestes urva, the habitat selection and daily activity patterns were analyzed and discussed by using the occupancy model and kernel density estimation method. The results showed that: (1) The appearance of Herpestes urva was concentrated in the low and middle altitude area with the highest frequency in the evergreen deciduous broad-leaved forest, and the lowest frequency in the deciduous broad-leaved forest and theropencedrymion. (2) Among 8 factors influencing habitat selection, altitude, water source, theropencedrymion, and evergreen deciduous broad-leaved forest are of great significance. Herpestes urva prefers living in the evergreen deciduous broad-leaved forest (β= 1. 79 ± 1. 19 S E ), and obviously repels the theropencedrymion (β = - 1. 9 3 ± 1. 30 SE). Altitude and water source distance significantly negatively correlate to occupancy rate.

Morphologically similar species tend to have similar ecological niches. Therefore, morphological similarities among sympatric species may be related to both overlap in diel activity and possibilities for competition. In carnivores, competition is often strong and asymmetric. Africa contains one of the most species rich carnivore assemblages in the world, where the African lion (Panthera leo) is dominant wherever it is present. Using camera trap data on South African carnivores, we evaluated how overlap with lions in diel activity related to similarities to lions in body mass, skull and long bone morphology. We found a positive association between overlap in diel activity with lions and similarities in log body mass, but we only observed this association using dry season activity data. We found no associations between overlap in diel activity with lions and similarities in either long bone or skull morphology, nor did we find associations between differences in overlap in diel activity within species between one reserve with and one without lions and morphological similarity with lions. Our results suggest that niche utilization rather than avoidance of lions dictated carnivore diel activity, although we acknowledge that lion avoidance could have been manifested in spatial rather than temporal separation.

We determined that the most suitable habitat area in the entire Western Ghats is 21,853 km2, in four well-defined isolated blocks. The brown palm civet distribution is more towards the south, ranging from Kakkad to Anamalai. The distribution on the north side is in the Nilgiris, Bhadra, and the Sahyadri.

In a heavy snowfall area in northeastern Japan, we clarified the diel activity patterns of and seasonal differences in three sympatric carnivores (red foxes, raccoon dogs, and Japanese martens) during winter and spring, and the interspecific differences among the activity patterns in each season. The activity time of the target species was obtained by camera-trap surveys at seven sites around the Experimental Forest of Yamagata University from January to June 2019. The diel activity patterns of each species, and seasonal and interspecific differences in the activity patterns were evaluated using the kernel density method. Red foxes showed a unimodal nocturnal pattern inspring, whereas they were also observed during the daytime in winter. Raccoon dogs showed a unimodal nocturnal pattern, and peak activity after sunset in both seasons. Japanese martens were clearly nocturnal during both seasons.

The number of captures by camera trapping were less for both sexes of both deer in wet season. Male and female Bawean deer were active throughout the day and night during all seasons, with several activity peaks during the 24h period, while male and female red muntjac show diurnal activity levels with higher peaks 1h after sunrise until 1h before sunset. There was no significant difference in activities between males and females for both deer. The amount of nocturnal activity corresponding to differences in nocturnal luminosity for Bawean deer varied, but not for the red muntjac. Free-roaming dog and Bawean deer presented opposite peak activities, while dhole as (the predator of the red muntjac) and red muntjac were both cathemeral. The differences between the two similar-sized species could be closely related to reduction of predation risk and increasing foraging success. © 2021 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología.",2021,"10.12933/therya-21-1087","12","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100534236&doi=10.12933%2ftherya-21-1087&partnerID=40&md5=370b5b010f3fbec82e66a3acefe8bb3d",NA,"149-161",NA,229

We assessed the potential for facilitative/competitive interactions between the two most widespread carnivores in the world, the wolf and the red fox, in a prey-rich area recently recolonized by the apex predator. One could expect that the superior competitor would ecologically suppress the inferior one, leading to avoidance of the former by the latter. In a Mediterranean coastal area (2017–2018), we assessed spatiotemporal and dietary interspecific overlap and investigated whether the recovery of wolves affected food habits of foxes. Spatiotemporal overlap was extensive (0.84–0.89). Wild ungulates were the staple of the wolf diet ( 88–90%); foxes used mainly invertebrates and fruits ( 78%), with ungulates being a substantial food category (13% of diet; 66% of occurrences among vertebrate prey). Interspecific dietary overlap was low (0.23), but extensive (0.89) for vertebrate prey. In comparison to a preceding wolf-free period, the volume and occurrence of large mammals in the diet of foxes showed a 2.8- to 3.5-fold increase. Apparently, foxes did not avoid wolves, which provided additional food to the foxes as prey leftovers. In a rich community, the presence of wolves may increase the food spectrum of foxes. Temporal variation of facilitation vs. competition should be assessed in relationship to spatiotemporal changes of predator–prey numbers. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London,",2021,"10.1093/biolinnean/blaa139","132","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099693734&doi=10.1093%2fbiolinnean%2fblaa139&partnerID=40&md5=2ed87e23257bc9acc8fd9f6861f37c4f","Canidae and diet and carnivore and Mammalia and predator-prey interaction and facilitation and dietary overlap and spatiotemporal analysis and Ungulata and canid and Vulpes and Vertebrata and Invertebrata","196-210",NA,230

Basic ecological understanding like population density, distribution, habitat-use patterns of small carnivores is lacking. This inadequate knowledge has led to disagreement between conservation approaches in different landscapes. Honey badgers (Mellivora capensis) are cryptic carnivores distributed across large areas of Africa and Asia; however, fundamental ecological knowledge is scarce. The species is thought to exist at low population densities throughout its range. We used a large camera trap dataset from a tiger reserve in Maharashtra State, India to understand the population density, habitat preference, and diel activity pattern of the species. We applied an extension of the spatial count model for the estimation of population. Habitat preference analyses were carried out using generalized linear models and activity patterns were analyzed using kernel-density functions. The population density was estimated as 14.09 (95% CI 10–22.25) individuals per 100 km2. Habitat use revealed a positive association with forest cover and negative association with elevation. This may expose the species to other large carnivores in the habitat but honey badger activity pattern peaked at midnight retaining minimum temporal overlap with other large carnivores (e.g., tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus, and dhole Cuon alpinus) and moderate overlap with small carnivores (e.g., jungle cat Felis chaus, rusty-spotted cat Prionailurus rubiginosus). These behaviors, in turn, may facilitate the coexistence of species at such high density even with high carnivore density. We hope the findings of this study will fill the existing knowledge gap of this species and aid in guiding the conservation of the species in other landscapes and reserves. © Copyright © 2020 Chatterjee, Nigam and Habib.",2020,"10.3389/fevo.2020.585256","8","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099032750&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2020.585256&partnerID=40&md5=b048c700e04a5c6fd9e1b455bbc17293",NA,NA,NA,231

This study focuses on two sympatric canids, the African wolf and the side-striped jackal, to evaluate their group size and spatiotemporal activity patterns in the use of a limited resource by monitoring artificial waterholes in a semi-arid environment located in Senegal (West Africa). Remote cameras were deployed at five artificial waterholes to evaluate the number of individuals, age and activity patterns of resource use. African wolves (n = 71; 31% of all carnivore detections) and side-striped jackals (n = 104; 45%) were the most detected carnivore species. While both canids tended to occur alone at waterholes, they showed an evident monthly variation in group size. Both species showed a high activity overlap, with a bimodal activity pattern in waterhole use. However, we found evidence of unidirectional spatiotemporal avoidance, suggesting African wolves might be dominant over side-striped jackals. Our findings provide useful insights to investigate niche partitioning on the use of limited resources and have conservation implications for regions with a prolonged dry season. © 2020 by the authors.

Animals may move away in space or time to avoid human interaction. For species of particular conservation concern, such as Baird's tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) and jaguars (Panthera onca), a better understanding of how they respond to different levels and types of disturbance is needed in order to manage human visitation to parks in ways that minimize negative outcomes for wildlife. We describe the overlap in activity patterns of tapirs, jaguars, and humans at logged and unlogged sites and at places with low versus high human visitation using camera survey data from protected areas of NW Belize, 2013–2016. Tapirs were nocturnal in all study sites, with ¿ 80% of all tapir detections occurring between 1900 hr and 0500 hr. Their activity patterns were not different in unlogged versus logged sites and did not change with increased human traffic. Jaguars were cathemeral across sites but had more nocturnal activity at the site with the most human impact. Activity pattern overlap between tapirs and jaguars did not differ significantly between logged and unlogged sites, nor between areas with low and high human activity. Human traffic increased from 2013 to 2016 at most of the study locations. In conclusion, this camera trap dataset suggests that non-consumptive human disturbance does not alter the activity patterns of tapirs and jaguars in protected areas lacking hunting pressure.

Grazing,which is one of the most important human disturbances, will change the characteristics of wildlife resource utilizationthrough resource competition (such as food, time, and space) and even affect the survival of sympatric species. NorthChinese leopard is a unique and rare wildlife species in China. Its wild prey population is decreasing due to the increasingresources competition between wild prey and livestock. Therefore, we should understand the characteristics of spatial? temporal utilization for domestic and wild animals to assess the survival of wildlife. In this study, 62 infrared automaticcameras were set up to obtain the activity data of four kinds of mammals in Tie Qiao Shan provincial nature reserve formOctober 2018 to May 2019. Two?species single season model and kernel density estimation were used to analyze the spatialinteraction and diurnal rhythm between the leopard and prey in a captive breeding period and cage?free period, and theoverlap of activity rhythm between the two species was calculated using the coefficient of overlap. The results showed that thespatial avoidance of leopard?roe deer and leopard?wild boar decreased during grazing, which may be the compensationmechanism for the increase in temporal overlap. North Chinese leopard?cattle had the strongest spatial avoidance. Thespatial?temporal overlap of leopard?cattle was not significant. Moreover, it was large for cattle?roe deer, while that of cattle? wild boar was small. This study showed that the grazing affected the spatial?temporal coexistence relationship between theNorth Chinese leopard and prey, and may have led to the potential risk of intensified human?leopard conflict. The results ofthe daily activity rhythm showed that the roe deer were diurnal, while wild boars were crepuscular.

Spatial and temporal patterns of segregation were investigated in a 1,085-km2 area of Serengeti National Park, Tanzania from 2010–2012. We used occupancy analysis to quantify habitat use and kernel density estimators and Mardia–Watson–Wheleer tests to analyse activity patterns. We found evidence for habitat divergence but high temporal overlap between species. Servals selected for grassland and avoided shrubland and wooded grassland. In contrast, the findings showed that caracals avoided grassland and woodland–shrubland; however, 73% of caracals were detected in wooded grassland. Overall, caracals and servals co-occurred independently, Species Interaction Factor, (phi = 1). This indicates that differential use of habitats in part facilitated coexistence of caracals and servals.

The BMTCH relies on indirect negative effects of large carnivores through suppression of mesocarnivore activity and habitat use. Importantly, effects of top carnivores on mesocarnivores varies over time and space, is dependent on the species involved, and local context. In South Africa, there are very few free-ranging carnivores, as populations are often restricted to enclosed reserves. While predator-proof fences reduce human-wildlife conflict, they also influence space use within communities. We used an enclosed reserve with a relatively full complement of carnivores to test the generality of the BMTCH in the African context. Using single-species, multi-season occupancy models we investigated the spatial dynamics of multiple carnivores. We also investigated spatial partitioning by vegetation type and temporal partitioning. Our results revealed both support for and against the BMTCH. Lions and spotted hyaenas negatively influenced the detection probability of black-backed jackals and African wildcats, while leopards had a positive effect on these two mesocarnivore species. Additionally, lions positively influenced the detection probability of side-striped jackals. Although space use of carnivores in relation to vegetation type showed minimal evidence of spatial partitioning, each carnivore had a unique combination of abiotic and biotic factors influencing their spatial dynamics, which could facilitate co-existence. Temporal partitioning may also be promoting co-existence as activity patterns of smaller carnivores overlapped the least with sympatric carnivores, particularly lions. Extensive activity overlap between large carnivores does not promote co-existence. We suggest that applying the BMTCH as a universal law across ecosystems is unsupported and may lead to inappropriate conservation and management actions, and prevent protection of ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",2020,"10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125844","56","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085520879&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnc.2020.125844&partnerID=40&md5=7217cf18fb3bc9f517893a6bad8d3a5b","habitat use and biodiversity and South Africa and carnivore and environmental protection and savanna and Canis adustus and Canis mesomelas and nature-society relations and restoration ecology and vegetation type",NA,NA,237

They are particularly interesting because their Asian range spans a diversity of habitats in the fastest disappearing forests in the world and encompasses a guild which differs in composition from place to place. As a part of a wider camera-trapping study of this guild, involving 2948 camera traps at 45 sites in nine countries, and paralleling a similar study of the Sunda clouded leopard including a further 1544 camera traps spanning 22 sites distributed across two countries, we deployed 84 pairs of camera traps for 107 days in 2014 and 2015 at Langtang National Park, Nepal between 1823 and 3824 m a.s.l. within a grid encompassing c. 120 km2. We documented the presence of clouded leopards for the first time at an altitude as high as 3498 m a.s.l. Naïve occupancy for clouded leopard was 8.6% (correcting for detection, 10.1%). Clouded leopards were least active in the middle of the day, and largely crepuscular and nocturnal, as were the common leopards and leopard cats. The peak of clouded leopard activity overlapped with that of musk deer. Prey species for both clouded leopard and common leopard were available across the elevation range studied although the availability of some prey species declined as elevation increased, whereas Himalayan serow, Himalayan goral, and musk deer showed no association with elevation. Before this study, there was no hard evidence that clouded leopards occurred above 2300 m a.s.l., having documented them at almost 4000 m a.s.l. in the Himalayas, we emphasise the importance of this extreme portion of the species’ range where climate is likely to change more rapidly and with greater consequences, than the global average. The discovery of clouded leopards in Langtang National Park considerably extends their known range, and raises the possibility that they occur from the Terai in southern Nepal up to the Nepal-Tibet (China) border in the north.

Despite their widespread use, the effects of predator-prey interactions and human disturbances on wildlife within underpasses have not been well studied. To understand the effect of species interactions and human disturbances on wildlife traveling through underpasses, we analyzed camera data from 3 underpasses in Hallelujah Junction Wildlife Area, Sierra County, California, USA, from June 2017 to December 2018. We recorded 3,589 detections, which were predominately mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), rodents, lagomorphs, California quail (Callipepla californica), bobcats (Lynx rufus), mountain lions (Puma concolor), and coyotes (Canis latrans). We used occupancy modeling and daily activity estimates to analyze species' spatial and temporal activity within the underpasses. Predator-prey interactions and human disturbances were among the most important factors that influenced wildlife travel through the underpasses. Mule deer avoided underpasses highly used by mountain lions, and mountain lions followed mule deer daily temporal activity patterns and seasonal activity patterns. These results indicate that predator-prey interactions influenced deer and mountain lion use of the underpasses. Coyotes favored underpasses and seasons with higher rodent and lagomorph presence, suggesting that the presence of prey was also important to coyote use of the underpasses. Coyotes, mountain lions, and bobcats all exhibited either temporal or spatial avoidance of human activity within the underpasses. California quail avoided predators within the underpasses and favored underpasses and times with high human activity. Our study suggests that underpass managers need to closely monitor the effect of predator-prey interactions and human activity on wildlife within underpasses to ensure these interactions do not discourage wildlife from using them. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society",2020,"10.1002/jwmg.21801","84","english","2","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076402693&doi=10.1002%2fjwmg.21801&partnerID=40&md5=850a2ccfbb261e1e644d7717e33a3eae","Puma concolor and Rodentia and Cervidae and California and Canis latrans and Lynx rufus and conservation planning and deer and anthropogenic effect and felid and rodent and predator-prey interaction and human activity and United States and Odocoileus hemionus and lagomorph and Lagomorpha and road and environmental disturbance and Callipepla californica and Sierra County [California]","227-236",NA,241

What has received less attention is whether and how resource partitioning among sympatric species in urban areas facilitates their coexistence. We examined the spatial, temporal and combined spatiotemporal occurrence and overlap of co-existing yellow mongoose Cynictis penicillata and slender mongoose Galerella sanguinea in an urban estate in South Africa. The reserve comprised two parts, an Eco-Estate where human residential and natural areas are interspersed and wildlife has greater contact with people, and a Nature Estate, where contact is reduced by palisade fencing between people and natural areas. Using photographic data from camera traps collected over 11 consecutive months, we found a moderate level of spatial overlap between the mongoose species. Differences between the species occurred at a finer habitat scale: yellow mongooses were more common in open habitats located near human residents whereas the slender mongooses were more common in covered areas further away from human residents. The detection probability of the yellow mongoose, however, was greater than that of the slender mongoose, and the occupancy probability of the slender mongoose was reduced in the presence of the yellow mongoose. Although both species demonstrated bimodal diurnal peaks in activity, they varied in their active periods, with temporal overlap being greater during colder than warmer months. No complete spatiotemporal overlap (occurrence in the same place at the same time/within a 10-min period) occurred. This may have been as a result of the difference in detection and occupancy probabilities of the two species. Resource availability (food), however, appears to influence the different habitat selection, space use, and activity patterns of yellow and slender mongoose in the study area. Therefore, we conclude that partitioning along the spatial and somewhat on the temporal dimensions aids in the coexistence of these mongoose species in an urban environment. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

One explanation is that brighter moonlight is associated with increased risk of predation (Predation Risk hypothesis), but it has also been proposed that nocturnal activity may be influenced by the sensory ecology of a species, with species that rely on visual detection of food and danger predicted to increase their activity during bright moonlight, while species relying on non-visual senses should decrease activity (Visual Acuity hypothesis). Lack of an objective measure of “visual acuity” has made this second hypothesis difficult to test, therefore we employed a novel approach to better understand the role of lunar illumination in driving activity patterns by using the tapetum lucidum as a proxy for “night vision” acuity. To test the alternative predictions, we analyzed a large dataset from our long-term camera trap study in Costa Rica using activity overlap, relative abundance, and circular statistical techniques. Mixed models explored the influence of illumination factors (moonrise/set, cloud cover, season) and night vision acuity (tapetum type) on nocturnal and lunar phase-related activity patterns. Our results support the underlying assumptions of the predation risk and visual acuity models, but indicate that neither can fully predict lunar-related activity patterns. With diurnal human “super predators” forcing a global increase in activity during the night by mammals, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of nocturnal activity patterns and the development of conservation approaches to mitigate forced temporal niche shifts. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,"10.1177/1940082920952405","13","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090760503&doi=10.1177%2f1940082920952405&partnerID=40&md5=0d5e208233461a47d6c6143529f49ddd",NA,NA,NA,243

The abundance and presence of the white-lipped peccary and the jaguar were directly related to decreasing water availability, while water was not a determining factor for the presence of the collared peccary and the puma. The decrease in the availability of water in the aguadas of the reserve has become a serious threat to the white-lipped peccary, one that, when coupled with other threats such as hunting and fragmentation of their habitat in the communities surrounding the reserve, will increase the risk of extinction of these populations, that at least for the white-lipped peccary, is the most important in Mesoamerica. © 2020 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología.",2020,"10.12933/therya-20-878","11","english","2","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083560704&doi=10.12933%2ftherya-20-878&partnerID=40&md5=f1ee9918fa12459c6558dc82e72cda42",NA,"213-220",NA,245

To support conservation efforts we analyzed the behavioral interactions between leopards (Panthera pardus), their prey, and tigers to determine if leopards fine-tune their activity to maximize contact with four prey species (sambar; wild boar; barking deer; banteng) and avoid tigers and if prey alter their temporal activity in response to variation in their relative abundance ratio with leopards. A lower density of sambar in the northern part of our study area and a lower density of wild boar and a higher density of tigers in the southern part allowed us to examine fine-grained differences in the behavior of leopards and their prey. We used camera trap data to investigate spatial and temporal overlap. Differences in tiger relative abundance did not appear to impact the temporal activity of leopards. Leopards had similar cathemeral activity at all sites with highest activity at dawn and dusk. This behavior appears to be a compromise to provide access to diurnal wild boar and barking deer and nocturnal sambar and banteng. Sambar showed higher temporal avoidance of leopards in the north where its RAI was lowest; in contrast, wild boar had the highest temporal avoidance in the south where its density was lowest. This is the first study in Southeast Asia to quantify spatial and temporal interactions between the leopard, its primary ungulate prey, and the tiger.

They have occupied many protected areas around the world, threatening natural ecosystems and causing environmental damage. To understand the potential pressures of free-ranging dogs, we investigated three main aspects of their population ecology by placing camera traps in ecologically distinct locations of the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (ARBR), southeastern Brazil. In this study, we assessed (i) the daily activity patterns according to circular kernel density function, (ii) the habitat selection according to occupancy models, and (iii) the population density according to spatial capture-recapture models. Free-ranging dogs in the ARBR are active irregularly (cathemeral behavior), display multiple daily activity peaks, and use approximately 73% of the study area. Our results suggest that free-ranging dogs exhibit broad temporal and spatial plasticity, so they can potentially harm a broad array of native species through competition or predation. The high temporal and spatial use range of free-ranging dogs is possibly a consequence of their high population density (0.55 ± SD 0.18 individuals/km2), representing one of the highest such estimates for the Atlantic Forest, and one that is higher than several estimates for ocelots, an ecologically similar native mesocarnivore. Our results suggest that the free-ranging dog population in the ARBR likely comprises a mix of domestic, stray, and feral individuals, with consequent management challenges that should focus on prevention, control, and perhaps eradication strategies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2019,"10.1007/s10344-019-1303-5","65","english","5","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073651545&doi=10.1007%2fs10344-019-1303-5&partnerID=40&md5=551dbb4a0261e33038db364d41f5d778",NA,NA,NA,248

In many parts of the world, apex predators live in, or are returning to, landscapes that have been modified by people; so, it is important to understand their ecological role in anthropogenic landscapes. We used motion-activated game cameras to compare the activity patterns of humans and 2 mesopredators, coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus), in areas with and without an apex predator, the gray wolf (Canis lupus), in a multiuse landscape of the northwestern United States. In areas with wolves, there was a significant increase in temporal niche overlap between the mesopredators owing to higher levels of coyote activity at all time periods of the day. Temporal overlap between mesopredators and humans also increased significantly in the presence of wolves. Coyotes exposed to wolves increased their activity during dawn, day, and dusk hours. The increase in coyote activity was greatest during the day, when wolves were least active. The direction of change in bobcat activity in areas with wolves was opposite to coyotes, suggesting a behaviorally mediated cascade between wolves, coyotes, and bobcats, although these findings would need to be confirmed with further research. Our findings suggest that mesopredators in human-dominated systems may perceive humans as less dangerous than apex predators, that humans may be more likely to encounter mesopredators in areas occupied by top predators, and that behaviorally mediated effects of apex predators on mesopredators persist in human-dominated landscapes. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, because of the difficulty or cost of evaluating these factors, habitat assessments may not include valuable information on important habitat attributes including the abundance and distribution of prey, predators, and competitors. Fishers (Pekania pennanti) are one of the most commonly reintroduced carnivores in North America, and they are a species of conservation concern in their western range. We examined the relative importance of landscape features and species interactions in determining habitat use of a reintroduced population of fishers in the southern Cascade Mountains, Washington, USA. We used detections of prey and predators at 134 remote camera stations, remotely sensed forest structure data, and telemetry locations of fishers in a resource selection function to assess the relative importance of prey, predators, and forest structure in fisher habitat selection. Fishers selected habitats based on forest conditions and activity levels of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), whereas bobcat (Lynx rufus) and coyote (Canis latrans) activity levels did not directly affect habitat selection. The probability of fisher use increased in older stands, close to recently disturbed stands, and in areas with intermediate levels of hare activity. Bobcat and hare activity levels were positively correlated, and fishers avoided areas with the greatest hare activity, suggesting that fishers may experience a food-safety tradeoff in the study area. Temporal activity patterns in photo detections indicate that fishers may mediate this danger by avoiding bobcats temporally. Our findings suggest that fishers in Washington prefer habitat mosaics of old and recently disturbed stands where they have greater access to resting structures and hares. Management that maintains mosaics of young and old forest across large landscapes is likely to support fisher recovery.

While ecological processes continue to operate within cities, urban ecosystems are profoundly different from their more natural counterparts. Thus, ecological predictions derived from more natural ecosystems are rarely generalizable to urban environments. In this study, we used data from a large-scale and long-term camera trap project in Chicago IL, USA, to determine whether urbanization alters predator-avoidance behaviour of urban prey species. We studied three behavioural mechanisms often induced by the fear of predation (spatial distribution, daily activity patterns and vigilance) of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) when coyote (Canis latrans)—an urban apex predator—was present. We found no evidence of spatial segregation between coyote and either prey species. Furthermore, neither white-tailed deer nor eastern cottontail changed their daily activity or increased vigilance in urban areas when coyotes were present. Eastern cottontail, however, had their uppermost level of vigilance in highly urban sites when coyotes were absent. Our study demonstrates that predator–prey dynamics might be modified in urban ecosystems—moving from what is traditionally thought of as a two-player system (predator and prey) to a three-player system (predator, prey and people). © 2019 The Authors.

We used automatically triggered wildlife cameras to assess the local distribution and co-existence of Canis latrans (Coyote), Vulpes vulpes (Red Fox), and Urocyon cinereoargenteus (Gray Fox) across the Pioneer Valley, MA, in relation to different levels of human development. We placed cameras at 79 locations in forested, altered, and urban land-use areas from September to November 2012 and accumulated 1670 trap nights. We determined site characteristics and detection rates for 12 other wildlife species for each camera location to develop a generalized linear model for the local distribution of each focal canid species across the study area. We also compared diel activity patterns among Coyotes, Red Foxes, and Gray Foxes, and calculated coefficients of overlap between each pair. The local distribution of Coyotes was positively associated with the detection rates of their prey and not associated with detection rates of sympatric carnivoran species. Red Foxes and Gray Foxes had negative relationships with the detection rate of Coyotes, and none of the 3 canid species showed a positive correlation with increased levels of urbanization. There was a high degree of temporal overlap in diel activity patterns and limited spatial overlap of our focal species, which suggests that any competition avoidance across our study area occurred at the spatial level.

Using camera-trap grids established in two important deciduous forests, Ankarafantsika National Park and Andranomena Special Reserve, we explore the activity patterns of endemic and exotic carnivores and evaluate how exotics may be influencing fosa temporal activity across these two protected areas. Three methodologies, kernel density, circular and wave analysis, were used to evaluate the activity pattern overlap between exotic free-ranging cats Felis sp. and dogs Canis familiaris, exotic small Indian civets Viverricula indica and the endemic fosa. Our results showed fosas to be cathemeral, peaking in activity in the evening and at dawn. Cats were nocturnal, whilst also highly active at dusk. Civets did not display a dominant period of activity, but were relatively more active in the night, and at dusk. In contrast, dogs were diurnal and also active at dawn, in alignment with human activity.

For felids, the main drivers of activity patterns appear to be prey availability and anthropogenic disturbances, as suggested by previous studies. In this study, we explore a set of variables that influence the activity patterns of Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) in Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces in north-east China near south-western Primorsky Krai, Russia. This area is currently the only occupied tiger habitat in China. Prey availability (e.g. wild boar, sika deer and roe deer), human disturbances (e.g. human activity, distance to human settlements and intense forest livestock grazing), and habitat structure were analysed. Our results revealed crepuscular and nocturnal activity of Amur tigers. Although the temporal overlaps between the tigers and their prey species were high, the spatial overlap indices were low. Although the presence of tigers decreased near human settlements, tigers showed a preference for walking along roads. Tigers also avoided high-elevation coniferous and mixed hardwood forests. Overall, our results indicated that (1) tigers spatially and temporally avoided human disturbances and tigers respond behaviourally to human disturbances and (2) human disturbances may determine the activity of Amur tigers in north-east China.

In Argentina, populations have decreased significantly and it is considered Critically Endangered. We performed the first systematic survey of the presence and activity of the jaguar within Baritú National Park, in the Yungas ecoregion. Twenty-eight independent stations were established with two camera traps each, with an average distance of 2-3 km among them. Samplings were carried out from August to November in 2014 and in 2015, and from August and September in 2016 and in 2017. A total of 98 records were obtained (43 in 2014, 18 in 2015, 19 in 2016, and 18 in 2017) of at least 9 individuals in 5153 camera days, resulting in 19 detections every 1000 camera days. Noteworthy was the lack of confirmed females or juveniles detected. The average minimum annual density (individuals/area) was 0.95/100 km2, and the combined minimum density (all surveys) was 1.15/100 km2. The jaguar’s activity was mostly crepuscular (7:00-9:00 h and 18:00-19:00 h) with some individual variation but consistent with what is reported for this species. The most abundant prey species were the tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and two species of brocket deer (Mazama sp.). The density of jaguars in this national park is potentially one of the highest in Argentina. Extending these studies is necessary to increase information regarding the situation of this and other species in this area of great conservation relevance in Argentina. © SAREM, 2019.",2019,"10.31687/saremMN.19.26.2.0.07","26","spanish","2","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078954618&doi=10.31687%2fsaremMN.19.26.2.0.07&partnerID=40&md5=963aa68b34f5d2a5e4b9c5ff27c7e096",NA,"390-398",NA,256

Among these are the ""standard four"", an assemblage of Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa, Asiatic Golden Cat Catopuma temminckii, Marbled Cat Pardofelis marmorata, and Leopard Cat Prionailurus bengalensis, which also occur across southeastern Asia. Within India, despite several surveys in this region, very little information exists on the ecology of this assemblage to explain their co-occurrence. In this paper, we put together data from several independent camera trapping studies over 10 sites across northeastern India to examine and interpret diel activity patterns of this group. While we present results for all the four species, we focus on two species, the Marbled Cat and Leopard Cat, which are of very similar body size and are potential competitors. We used kernel density estimates to measure diel activity patterns of all four species and overlap in activity between Marbled Cat and Leopard Cat at the regional scale as well as the point scale. We obtained 783 captures of the standard four from ¿ 27,500 trap nights. The Asiatic Golden Cat and Marbled Cat were strongly diurnal, Clouded Leopard largely crepuscular and nocturnal, and Leopard Cat largely nocturnal. The degree of overlap between Marbled Cat and Leopard Cat activity was low and in consensus with other studies across southeastern Asia. We interpret this as the differing niche spaces of the two cats due to their specific pre-existing adaptations, not restricted to the effects of competition. The point scale analysis when both cats are captured at the same location and separately show no shift in activity pattern, supporting our hypothesis of pre-existing differences in resources, such as food, playing a major role in facilitating co-existence. Our study, however, is preliminary and additional information with robust analysis is required to test this finding. © Mukherjee et al. 2019.",2019,"10.11609/jott.4662.11.4.13432-13447","11","english","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063989856&doi=10.11609%2fjott.4662.11.4.13432-13447&partnerID=40&md5=a186f8bffb5d95b7d0cdbe36b6fca892",NA,"13432-13447",NA,258

We conducted a multilandscape analysis of two widely distributed, threatened large carnivore competitors to offer insight into coexistence strategies and assist with species-level conservation. We evaluated how interference competition affects occupancy, temporal activity and population density of a dominant competitor, the lion (Panthera leo), and its subordinate competitor, the leopard (Panthera pardus). We collected camera-trap data over 3 years in 10 study sites covering 5,070 km2. We used multispecies occupancy modelling to assess spatial responses in varying environmental and prey conditions and competitor presence, and examined temporal overlap and the relationship between lion and leopard densities across sites and years. Results showed that both lion and leopard occupancy was independent of—rather than conditional on—their competitor's presence across all environmental covariates. Marginal occupancy probability for leopard was higher in areas with more bushy, “hideable” habitat, human (tourist) activity and topographic ruggedness, whereas lion occupancy decreased with increasing hideable habitat and increased with higher abundance of very large prey. Temporal overlap was high between carnivores, and there was no detectable relationship between species densities. Lions pose a threat to the survival of individual leopards, but they exerted no tractable influence on leopard spatial or temporal dynamics. Furthermore, lions did not appear to suppress leopard populations, suggesting that intraguild competitors can coexist in the same areas without population decline. Aligned conservation strategies that promote functioning ecosystems, rather than target individual species, are therefore advised to achieve cost- and space-effective conservation. © 2018 The Authors.

The medium and small Neotropical felids are an interesting group of carnivore species for studying intraguild competition. Due to differences in size it is expected that the larger ocelot exert strong interference competition on the smaller felids (southern tiger cat, margay and jaguarundi); which, in turn, may exert exploitative competition among themselves. Moreover, landscape changes due to human activities may alter these interspecific interactions. We studied the habitat use and the spatial and temporal interspecific relations of the medium and small Atlantic Forest felids, in a landscape with different levels of anthropogenic impact. We estimated the detection probability, and occupancy probability of these cats and whether these parameters are affected by environmental and anthropogenic variables or by the estimated occupancy and detection probability of the ocelot. We estimated the overlap in daily activity patterns between pairs of the four species and changes in their activity in response to anthropogenic impact. We also studied the potential changes that may have occurred in the daily activity of the small felids in relation to ocelot’s occupancy probability. The probability of habitat use of the small- and medium-size felids was negatively associated to the intensity of landscape use by humans. Co-occurrence models indicated that the probability of habitat use by southern tiger cats decreased with ocelot occupancy probability. This effect was higher as human disturbance increased. Moreover, the ocelot and the southern tiger cat became more nocturnal in sites with higher human access, suggesting that they may be temporally avoiding encounters with humans or dogs. Conservation of medium and small felids in the Atlantic Forest depends not only on the establishment and implementations of protected areas but also on the management of human’s land uses. © 2018 Cruz et al.

Humans affect carnivores in both spatial and temporal dimensions via the chance of human encounter and alteration of the landscape through urban development. We investigated three hypotheses regarding how humans mediate the sympatry of larger, dominant carnivores with their smaller, subordinate counterparts. We tested these hypotheses by examining the spatio-temporal dynamics of a dominant carnivore (coyote Canis latrans) and its subordinate competitor (red fox Vulpes vulpes) across an extensive urban park system. We found that dominant and subordinate carnivores exhibited strong and often opposing spatio-temporal responses to the probability of human encounter and urban development. Spatially, coyotes visited more highly developed sites less frequently while red foxes exhibited an opposing response. Temporally, both species avoided humans via nocturnal activity. Spatio-temporally, red foxes avoided coyotes at all sites and avoided humans at highly developed sites, whereas coyotes showed a positive association with humans at such sites. Our analysis indicates that areas with higher urban development might act as spatial refugia for some subordinate carnivores against interference from larger, dominant carnivores (a “human shield” effect). Our findings also reveal that broad-scale spatial avoidance is likely a crucial component of coexistence between larger, dominant carnivores and humans, whereas finer-scale spatio-temporal avoidance is likely a key feature of coexistence between humans and smaller, subordinate carnivores. Overall, our study underscores the complex and pervasive nature of human influence over the sympatry of competing carnivores inhabiting urban systems. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018,"10.1007/s11252-018-0758-6","21","english","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045464064&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-018-0758-6&partnerID=40&md5=763b61aacccc004c25422629be431a1a",NA,"765-778",NA,262

We used data from 224 camera traps set up in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania to evaluate patterns in detection rates, spatial distribution, and activity patterns of honey badgers. Our top models showed that the relative abundance of larger carnivores (e.g., African lions, Panthera leo, and spotted hyenas, Crocuta crocuta) was important, but surprisingly was positively related to honey badger distribution. These results suggest that honey badgers were not avoiding larger carnivores, but were instead potentially seeking out similar habitats and niches. We also found no temporal avoidance of larger carnivores. Honey badgers exhibited seasonal variation in activity patterns, being active at all times during the wet season with peaks during crepuscular hours, but having a strong nocturnal peak during the dry season.

Here, we describe the daily activity pattern of the northern tiger cat Leopardus tigrinus in semiarid drylands, an Endangered species in Brazil, and test its overlap with those of potential prey, small mammals and ground birds. Also, we test the effect of the lunar phase on the synchrony of the predator-prey interactions. Camera trap data were obtained from ten areas in the Caatinga of the Rio Grande do Norte state, totalling a sampling effort of 7271 camera-days. The northern tiger cat activity pattern was primarily nocturnal, although it shows a considerable crepuscular activity and some daytime activity. Results suggest a high activity overlap with small mammals, that were strongly nocturnal, but a low activity overlap with ground birds that were diurnal and crepuscular. The lunar cycle did not affect the activity of the northern tiger cat, but changed the activity of small mammals, which were most active during new moon phase. A feeding study performed in another geographic region of the Caatinga suggests, in contrast, that northern tiger cats should have a higher activity during the day or during the crepuscular period. Our results suggest that the stressful conditions of the day period in the Caatinga drylands, the virtual absence of nocturnal top predators in our study area, and the higher availability of small mammals during the night are propably shaping the activity pattern of the northern tiger cat.

Here, we evaluated if temporal separation existed among jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor) and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and if their activity patterns were related to that of a particular prey. We used camera trap records to estimate the activity schedules of these predators and their prey. We used the coefficient of overlapping (Δ; ranging from 0 to 1) to quantify the temporal interactions between predators and prey, and calculated confidence intervals from bootstrap samples. Strong temporal overlap occurred among the three felids (Δ = 0.63 - 0.82) in both dry and rainforests. However, a greater temporal separation was observed between the closest competitors (jaguar and puma, puma and ocelot). Jaguar and puma had a strong temporal overlap with medium and large-sized prey, while ocelots’ activity matched that of small-sized prey. High overlapping coefficients among the felids suggest that temporal segregation is not the main mechanism facilitating their coexistence in these areas.

Therefore, an attempt to understand the distribution of terrestrial animals using infra-red camera traps in Tanjung Datu National Park, Borneo, was carried out from July 2013 to October 2015 (28 months). A total of 23 camera locations set in various microhabitats and elevations accumulated 2,490 camera days, which resulted in 1,189 independent animal images comprised of 21 mammals, two birds, and one reptile species. The cameras revealed a total of 20 medium to large mammals (excluding treeshrews & small rodents), with the most common species photographed being the pig-tailed macaque (independent images n = 278) and bearded pig (271), while the masked palm civet (1) and Sunda pangolin (1) were only represented by singletons. Most of the common species are listed as Protected (33.64%) in the Sarawak Wild Life Protection Ordinance 1998, while 2.02% species have Totally Protected status. Less than 1% of the species are considered Critically Endangered and Endangered, 3.57% are considered Near Threatened, and 74.3% are considered Vulnerable under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In addition, this survey has provided detailed information on activity patterns of some cryptic species. The absence of larger carnivores suggests that species such as the Sunda clouded leopard and Bornean sun bear may have been extirpated from this small, isolated, and fragmented protected area.

Data were collected in the period 2010-2017 and the trap effort was 30 158 camera days from 21 locations. Most of the mammals surveyed showed activity at night and twilight hours (71% of the pictures). The hare was most active among all and dominant at night. In many respects it is similar to the activity of a raccoon dog, which type can be defined as nocturnal too. Unlike a hare, a raccoon dog has a weak peak in the daytime and less activity in the night. Badgers movements are confined to the twilight and nighttime. The share of nocturnal activity of large ungulates such as elk and wild boar was approximately the same and amounted to about 45% of all registrations. The wild boar is slightly more active during the day and in the evening and is not active at all in the morning. The elk is active in the morning, and in the daytime and to a lesser extent in the evening. The lynx and the bear have similar cathemeral activity patterns: Almost half of all their meetings occurred at daylight hours and only slightly - less than 40% - at night. The brown bear had the maximum number of registrations in the daytime among all the studied species. Despite the fact that the main object of lynx feeding in the reserve is the hare, there was no high degree of overlap between them (Δ= 0.75). In the group of large carnivores, the Wolf was noticeably distinguished, more than half of its registrations were at night, and a third - on daytime. Daily activities of the Wolf and its main prey elk showed a large overlap (Δ= 0.89). The seasonal variations of daily activity of all species were also shown. According to the results of factor analysis, each of the studied species was divided into one of three separate groups. The first group included species with a tendency to nocturnal activity (Wolf, elk, hare, badger, and raccoon dog), the second group - cathemeral animals (bear and lynx). In the third group was only the wild boar, whose activity was associated with the evening hours. This is the first long-term continuous camera trap survey in Russia and it provides detailed daily activity patterns for multiple large and medium-sized sympatric mammals. © Nature Conservation Research 2018.

The Network for Protection and Conservation of Amolar Mountain Ridge is an informal initiative that legally protects over 2000 km2 of the Pantanal biome. Several camera-trapping surveys were carried out at Amolar Mountain Ridge from August 2011 to September 2013 in order to increase our knowledge of the species occurrence and its ecological requirements. The aims of this study were : 1) to inventory the carnivore species occurring within this network of protected areas; 2) to describe their activity patterns and 3) to discuss threats for those species' conservation in the region. We used the Kernel density method to describe the species' activity patterns. We obtained 764 records (from 12703 camera-days) of eight carnivores, including endangered species in Brazil, such as the jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor), and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), that were among the most frequently recorded by camera traps. The other species detected were the South America coati (Nasua nasua), the tayra (Eira barbara), the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) and the jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi). We provided information on activity patterns of the jaguar and puma, which exhibited cathemeral activity patterns, on the ocelot and crab-eating fox, which were mostly nocturnal, and on the Southern coati and jaguarundi, which were diurnal. Scansorial and species that occur naturally in low densities as the tayra and the crab-eating raccoon were difficult to be detected with the used camera trapping setting. However, due to the natural characteristics of the study area, camera trapping is among the most appropriate tools for providing data about carnivores and their prey.

This is particularly relevant for large-bodied vertebrates that are especially sensitive to human presence and human-driven habitat changes. Assessing the impact of anthropogenic disturbance requires data on distribution and activity patterns of target species in relation to human presence and infrastructures. Here, we used camera trap data to study the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on the community of medium-to-large mammals in a mountainous area in the eastern Italian Alps, with emphasis on the local population of brown bear (Ursus arctos). In 2015, we sampled a study area of 220 km2 with 60 camera trap locations adopting a systematic grid. Such design was inspired by the terrestrial vertebrate monitoring protocol developed by the TEAM Network, a pan-tropical biodiversity programme. Camera traps run for 30 days in each site and cumulated 1978 camera trapping days, yielding 1514 detection events of 12 species of mammals. For the 8 most recorded species, we used detection/non-detection data to model estimated occupancy and detection probability in relation to a suite of environmental and disturbance covariates. Our analysis revealed that human disturbance plays a significant role in influencing species-specific detection probability, while we found little evidence of significant relationship between occupancy and anthropogenic disturbance. For example, we found that brown bear's detectability was negatively correlated with capture rate of humans at sampling sites, and positively correlated with distance from settlements. We also assessed species-specific daily activity patterns and found that, for all species, the overlap with human diel pattern decreased significantly at sites with higher human presence. We also discuss the potential of our approach for cost-efficient and long-term monitoring of mammals. © 2017 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde",2017,"10.1016/j.mambio.2017.05.005","87","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033717939&doi=10.1016%2fj.mambio.2017.05.005&partnerID=40&md5=a3608654a22b90547225a1bc79a7b2a1","biodiversity and disturbance and activity pattern and bear and Mammalia and trapping and anthropogenic effect and detection method and mountain region and vertebrate and reproduction and Vertebrata and Ursus arctos and Italy and diel variation and Alps","50-61",NA,270

We analyzed the diet of the Wolf (Canis lupus) to point out its elective prey and we investigated its spatial and temporal interactions with prey species from December 2012 to November 2014 in the Ligurian Alps (Southern Alps, Italy). In this area, the Wolf is the only large predator, and there is a rich wild ungulate community consisting of four species. Our analyses showed that the most consumed species by wolves were the wild boar (Sus scrofa) and the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). To successfully hunt these species, wolves need to share their spatial range, searching for them in the most suitable habitat types and in the periods of the diel cycle during which they are mainly active. Fallow deer (Dama dama) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) consumption was low, and wolves showed also relatively low overlap with these species. Our results suggest that wolves might be firstly specialized on wild boar predation, as they showed substantial spatial and temporal overlap with this species, and secondly on roe deer predation, especially during the denning season when they probably take advantage of the presence of fawns. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",2017,"10.1515/mammalia-2016-0066","81","english","6","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033787037&doi=10.1515%2fmammalia-2016-0066&partnerID=40&md5=10beeb7bdced4d2bec1cfd8c275c3214","Canidae and diet and Canis lupus and activity pattern and deer and felid and wild population and ungulate and predator-prey interaction and spatial distribution and prey selection and spatiotemporal analysis and Rupicapra rupicapra and Ungulata and habitat type and Sus scrofa and Italy and Capreolus and Capreolus capreolus and Dama dama and Alps and Ligurian Alps and New Zealand and South Island and Southern Alps and Western Alps","537-551",NA,271

We used camera traps in Dampa Tiger Reserve (TR), Mizoram, northeastern India, to estimate population density and describe activity patterns of 2 rare felids, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) and marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata). With a survey effort of 4,962 trap nights, we obtained 84 photo-captures of clouded leopards and 36 of marbled cats. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to estimate population densities of both species. Using the Bayesian approach implemented in SPACECAP, we derived estimates of 5.14 (± 1.80 SD)/100 km 2 for clouded leopards and 5.03 (± 2.07 SD)/100 km 2 for marbled cats. Using camera-trap images, we compared diel activity patterns and activity overlaps for these 2 rare felids, together with 3 other sympatric carnivores, by estimating a coefficient of overlap between species. Among felids, clouded leopards and golden cats (Catopuma temminckii) displayed the highest overlap in activity, whereas marbled cats and leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) showed the lowest, with marbled cats being primarily diurnal and leopard cats nocturnal. Our study provides the first density estimates from continental Southeast Asia for marbled cats and one of the highest recorded densities for clouded leopards.

This study was conducted to understand the influences of free-range livestock on the wild mammalian population in Baluran National Park, Indonesia. There were 3852 and 1156 cows and goats, respectively, and livestock occupied an area of approximately 55.96 km2. The species richness and probability of occupancy in areas with and without livestock were assessed, and the spatial co-occurrence and overlap of daily activity patterns among mammalian species and livestock were measured. A total of 39 camera traps were installed from August 2015 to January 2016, collecting 23,021 independent photographs. In areas with livestock, the number of mammal species (eight) was lower than in areas without livestock (11 species). The most affected species were the large herbivores Bubalus bubalis and Bos javanicus, and a large carnivore Panthera pardus, all of which were absent in areas with livestock. Regardless of the feeding guild, the probability of occupancy of almost all species declined in areas with livestock, except the medium herbivores Paradoxurus hermaphroditus and Hystrix javanica that showed a higher probability of occupancy. The species whose probability of occupancy declined were the carnivores Cuon alpinus and Prionailurus bengalensis; the herbivores Rusa timorensis, Tracypithecus auratus and Muntiacus muntjak; and the omnivore Sus scrofa. In the presence of livestock, R. timorensis and S. scrofa changed their activities from diurnal to nocturnal. Livestock affected most wild mammals in several ways, including by reducing the species richness, lessening the probability of occupancy and changing the daily activity patterns of many animals.

We investigated how hiking, mountain biking, equestrians, and recreationists with domestic dogs affected habitat use and diel activity patterns of ten species of medium and large-sized mammals in the San Francisco Bay ecoregion. We used camera traps to quantify habitat use and activity patterns of wild mammals and human recreationists at 241 locations in 87 protected areas. We modeled habitat use with a multi-species occupancy model. Species habitat use was most closely associated with environmental covariates such as landcover, precipitation, and elevation. Although recreation had less influence on habitat use, the presence of domestic dogs was negatively associated with habitat use of mountain lions and Virginia opossum. We also compared diel activity patterns of species at sites with no observed recreation to the activity patterns of species at sites with high (≥ eight per day) levels of non-motorized recreation. Coyotes were more active at night and less active during the day in areas with high levels of recreation. Striped skunks were slightly more active later into the morning in areas that allowed human recreation. Smaller carnivores with nocturnal activity patterns may not be directly affected by recreational activities that are limited to daylight hours. We suggest that by maintaining habitat free of domestic dogs, and creating trail-free buffers, land managers can manage recreation in a way that minimizes impacts to wildlife habitat and preserves the value of protected areas to people and wildlife. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017,"10.1016/j.biocon.2016.11.003","207","english",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008457836&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2016.11.003&partnerID=40&md5=d35fb759ae20e23d483a6718bae33995","Puma concolor and habitat use and Canis familiaris and California and Canis latrans and Animalia and ecoregion and Mammalia and mammal and anthropogenic effect and Bayesian analysis and trap (equipment) and spatiotemporal analysis and United States and behavioral response and nocturnal activity and ecological modeling and protected area and nature conservation and Didelphis virginiana and Mephitis and outdoor recreation and San Francisco Bay","117-126",NA,274

Some studies indicate that L. pardalis exerts a strong influence on other smaller felids. Our goal in this study was to estimate the density and activity patterns of these felid species in two vegetation types at Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, southwestern Mexico. We expected that L. pardalis had a high density relative to other felids due to its ecological plasticity, as well as segregation in the activity pattern between species. We placed camera traps in 22 sites in the semi-evergreen forest and 22 sites in the cloud forest, from July 2014 to June 2015. We estimated density using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber probabilistic model with the program MARK and assessed the degree of activity overlapping between species by the coefficient of overlapping Δ1 in the program R. We recorded low abundance of L. pardalis (8.3 individuals) and a higher abundance of L. wiedii (51.5 individuals). The density of both species was 7.8 individuals/100 km2 and 81 individuals/100 km2, respectively. Both species displayed predominantly nocturnal activity. The overlap coefficient between species in the semi-evergreen forest was high (Δ1 = 0.75, CI = 0.63-0.90). Factors such as differences in vegetation type and the presence of a large number of transient individuals may influence the density of Leopardus. The lower density of L. pardalis and the high conservation status of the cloud forest may contribute to the higher density of L. wiedii in Sierra Norte of Oaxaca. Our results suggested that both species showed a highly overlapping activity pattern, and the activity pattern of the margay is seemingly unaffected by the presence of the ocelot.

Animals typically must forage while simultaneously avoiding predation from multiple potential predators, but habitat use in tropical forest ecosystems that assesses effects of both predation risk and resources has rarely been conducted. We used camera traps and occupancy analyses to document small mammalian carnivore occurrence in relation to food abundance and interactions with large predators. We hypothesized that habitat use of six small mammalian carnivores (≤15 kg) would be influenced by (1) abundance of resources (fruit, rodents, and streams) and/or (2) large predators. Predictions regarding food and habitat resources were only supported for one species (crab-eating mongoose, Urva urva), which was positively associated with rodents and streams. Three small carnivores (masked palm civet Paguma larvata, common palm civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula) were affected negatively by leopard and mesopredators as predicted. Counter to our predictions, two species (masked palm civet and yellow-throated marten) showed spatial avoidance of tiger suggesting that an apex predator might also pose predation risk to small carnivores. The focal small carnivores and large predators of this study appeared to have moderately to highly overlapping temporal activity indicating no temporal avoidance. In conclusion, food resources appeared to have minimal effects for six small carnivores in this ecosystem probably due to continuous resource availability. Predation risk appeared to affect some species in terms of spatial occupancy but not in temporal activity, indicating perhaps complex, but not entirely negative interactions between larger carnivores and this guild of small carnivores. The mechanisms which facilitate co-occurrence between small carnivores and large predators may, however, operate at finer spatiotemporal scales than we investigated here. © 2016, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.",2017,"10.1007/s13364-016-0283-z","62","english","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009446576&doi=10.1007%2fs13364-016-0283-z&partnerID=40&md5=d2b02d9ba4e4a6c6f4e997cebe027527","habitat use and abundance and Rodentia and Animalia and carnivore and Panthera pardus and Mammalia and trap (equipment) and predation risk and intraguild interaction and avoidance reaction and small mammal and resource availability and Herpestes urva and Thailand and Martes flavigula and Paradoxurus hermaphroditus and Paguma larvata and temporal distribution","21-36",NA,277

The mesopredator release hypothesis therefore predicts prey abundance will be higher where large carnivores are present, but this prediction assumes limited dietary overlap between large and mesocarnivores. Where dietary overlap is high, e.g., among omnivorous carnivore species, or where prey are relatively easily accessible, the potential exists for large and mesocarnivores to have redundant impacts on prey, though this possibility has not been explored. The intertidal community represents a potentially important but poorly studied resource for coastal carnivore populations, and one for which dietary overlap between carnivores may be high. To evaluate usage of the intertidal community by coastal carnivores and the potential for redundancy between large and mesocarnivores, we surveyed (i) intertidal prey abundance (crabs and fish) and (ii) the abundance and activity of large carnivores (predominantly black bears) and mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink) in an area with an intact carnivore community in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Overall carnivore activity was strongly related to intertidal prey availability. Notably, this relationship was not contingent on carnivore species identity, suggestive of redundancy±high intertidal prey availability was associated with either greater large carnivore activity or greater mesocarnivore activity. We then compared intertidal prey abundances in this intact system, in which bears dominate, with those in a nearby system where bears and other large carnivores have been extirpated, and raccoons are the primary intertidal predator. We found significant similarities in intertidal species abundances, providing additional evidence for redundancy between large (bear) and mesocarnivore (raccoon) impacts on intertidal prey. Taken together, our results indicate that intertidal prey shape habitat use and competition among coastal carnivores, and raise the interesting possibility of redundancy between mesocarnivores and large carnivores in their role as intertidal top predators. © 2017 Suraci et al.

Recently, some studies demonstrated the use of this technique to study temporal predator-prey interactions, most of which focused on large felids. In this study, we investigate the activity patterns of the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis)—a medium-sized neotropical cat—and its known potential prey in the Brazilian Pantanal using photographs taken by camera traps. We tested for seasonal differences in activity patterns, and assessed the patterns of temporal overlap between this felid and three known potential prey: the Brazilian rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), Azara's agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), and Paraguayan punaré (Thrichomys pachyurus). We estimated activity patterns using kernel density and measured the overlap between estimated paired distributions using a coefficient of overlap, hypothesizing that activity patterns would change between the rainy and dry season, and that overlap would be higher with rodents since they comprise the bulk of the ocelot's diet in the Pantanal and elsewhere. Azara's agouti and the Paraguayan punaré were the only species that presented significant changes in their activity patterns between seasons. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was low coincidence of activity patterns between ocelots and Azara's agouti for both seasons, but temporal overlap between ocelots and Paraguayan punarés was high with no significant difference, at least in the dry season. Overall, temporal overlap between ocelots and Brazilian rabbits was high, with no significant differences. In general, our results suggest that ocelots may tailor their activity to that of some of their potential prey to increase the probability of encounters.

We used camera-trap and sign surveys to examine whether other carnivores were using the same travel routes as snow leopards at two spatial scales. We also considered temporal interactions between species. Our results confirm that other carnivores, including the red fox Vulpes vulpes, grey wolf Canis lupus, Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and dhole Cuon alpinus, occur along snow leopard travel routes, albeit with low detection rates. Even at the smaller scale of our camera trap survey all five carnivores (snow leopard, lynx, wolf, red fox and dhole) were observed. Kernel density estimates suggested a high degree of temporal overlap between the snow leopard and the fox, and the snow leopard and the lynx, as indicated by high overlap coefficient estimates. There is an opportunity to consider protective measures at the local scale that would benefit various species simultaneously.

From 2008 to 2013, we photographically surveyed a diverse rainforest landscape, comparing six native and three exotic carnivores' activity patterns throughout the diel cycle. We used hierarchical Bayesian Poisson analysis to describe the activity patterns of Madagascar's carnivore community, assessed effects of season and site on temporal activity patterns, and estimated coefficients of overlap between carnivore pairings to assess effects of body size and ecological niche on temporal overlap among native and exotic carnivores. We observed changes in temporal activity patterns across seasons particularly during the austral summer (hot-dry season) for four native and two exotic carnivores, including evidence of fossa Cryptoprocta ferox altering their temporal activity during their mating season (hot-dry season). We found evidence of high overlap between natives and exotics indicating the potential for increased interactions and competition. The greatest overlap in temporal activity occurred between both ring-tail Galidia elegans and brown-tail vontsira Salanoia concolor and exotic dogs Canis familiaris. Cr.ferox, falanouc Eupleres goudotii and spotted fanaloka Fossa fossana also overlapped in activity with the nocturnal, exotic Indian civet Viverricula indica. Cr.ferox avoided humans and Ca.familiaris across all seasons. Unexpectedly, carnivore body size and ecological niche were not important predictors of temporal overlap.

Predation risk and resource availability are environmental cues which influence the behavioural decisions that make both predators and prey engage in activity bursts, and depending on their local importance, can be strong enough to override the endogenous regulation of an animals' circadian clock. In Southern Europe, wherever the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is abundant, it is the main prey of most mammalian mesopredators, and rodents are generally the alternative prey. We evaluated the bidirectional relation between the diel activity strategies of these mammalian mesopredators and prey coexisting in south-western Europe. Results revealed that even though predation risk enforced by mammalian mesocarnivores during night-time was approximately twice and five times higher than during twilight and daytime, respectively, murids consistently displayed unimodal nocturnal behaviour. Conversely, the European rabbits exhibited a bimodal pattern that peaked around sunrise and sunset. Despite the existence of some overlap between the diel rhythms of mesocarnivores and rabbits, their patterns were not synchronized. We suggest that the environmental stressors in our study areas are not severe enough to override the endogenous regulation of the circadian cycle in murids. European rabbits, however, are able to suppress their biological tendency for nocturnality by selecting a predominantly crepuscular pattern. In spite of the higher energetic input, mesocarnivores do not completely track rabbits' activity pattern. They rather track rodents' activity. We propose that these systems have probably evolved towards a situation where some degree of activity during high-risk periods benefits the overall prey population survival, while the accessibility to sufficient prey prevents predators to completely track them. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",2013,"10.1111/eth.12156","119","english","12","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886793174&doi=10.1111%2feth.12156&partnerID=40&md5=085046ba0bb8c5d545bac3c700beaed4","Rodentia and Animalia and activity pattern and Mammalia and predator-prey interaction and survival and predation risk and Oryctolagus cuniculus and resource availability and lagomorph and Muridae and diel migration and evolution and Southern Europe and twilight","1044-1056",NA,284

Recent studies suggest that the dingo, Australia's top terrestrial predator, inhibits predation on native mammals by the invasive red fox, and therefore reduces mammal extinctions. Feral cats also have negative effects on native mammals, but evidence that dingoes suppress cats remains equivocal. Aims We sought to examine whether dingoes might spatially or temporally suppress the activity of feral cats at a site containing the sole wild population of an endangered macropod subject to feral cat predation (the bridled nailtail wallaby). Methods We used camera traps to compare coarse and fine-scale spatial associations and overlaps in activity times of mammals between August 2009 and August 2010. Key results Dingoes and cats used the same areas, but there was evidence of higher segregation of activity times during wet months. Potential prey showed no spatial avoidance of dingoes. Peak activity times of dingoes and their major prey (the black-striped wallaby) were segregated during the wetter time of year (December to March). We did not find evidence that cats were spatially excluded from areas of high prey activity by dingoes, but there was low overlap in activity times between cats and bridled nailtail wallabies. Conclusions These findings support the contention that fear of dingoes can sometimes affect the timing of activity of feral cats. However, cats showed little spatial avoidance of dingoes at a coarse scale.

We used photographic sampling to quantify the temporal activity patterns of carnivores at 4 study sites.

In this study, we quantify temporal overlap between the Sumatran tiger and five of its presumed prey species from four study areas comprising disturbed lowland to primary submontane forest. Data from 126 camera traps over 8984 camera days were used to estimate species activity patterns and, in turn, their overlap through the coefficient Δ (ranging from 0 to 1, i.e. no overlap to complete overlap). A newly developed statistical technique was applied to determine confidence intervals associated with respective overlap, which is important, as such measures of precision are usually not estimated in these types of study. Strong temporal overlap was found between tiger and muntjac Muntiacus muntjac (Δ=0.80, 95%CI=0.71-0.84) and tiger and sambar Cervus unicolor (Δ=0.81, 0.55-0.85), with the latter illustrating the importance of measuring precision. According to the foraging theory, Sumatran tigers should focus on expending lower levels of energy searching for and then capturing larger bodied prey that present the least risk. Hence, surprisingly, there was little overlap between the crepuscular tiger and the largest-bodied prey species available, the nocturnal tapir Tapirus indicus (0.52, 0.44-0.60), suggesting that it is not a principal prey species. This study provides the first insights into Sumatran tiger-prey temporal interactions.

This potential exists on two of the California Channel Islands, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, as endemic island spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis amphiala) appear to have rapidly declined to rarity, possibly due to interference competition with endemic island foxes (Urocyon littoralis). Niche partitioning is expected in response to interference competition; hence, it is surprising that skunks and foxes show extensive overlap in macrohabitat use and circadian activity. However, the role of microhabitat associations and fine-scale temporal activity in facilitating coexistence of the two species has not been explored. We evaluated microhabitat associations of island spotted skunks and island foxes across both islands using data from live traps and wildlife cameras collected during 2015-2017, and we analyzed fine-scale temporal activity using camera data from 2016 and 2017. On both islands, skunks had a positive response to ground-level cover provided by rugged topography or woody vegetation such as shrubs or trees, whereas foxes had a weak or negative response, suggesting partitioning of these microhabitat characteristics. Additionally, on both islands the peak in timing of skunk activity offset the peak for foxes, which implies that skunks use fine-scale adjustments in activity to avoid foxes. Past grazing by exotic herbivores likely reduced habitat refuges for skunks; however, as vegetation on both islands recovers, regrowth of shrubs and trees may provide cover that will improve prospects for coexistence of island spotted skunks and island foxes.",2022,"10.1093/jmammal/gyab125","103",NA,"1",NA,NA,"28",NA,290

By using a quasi-experimental, non-intrusive approach, we go beyond the classical view that predators only compete for living prey and disentangle the mechanisms of exploitative and interference competition between two charismatic apex predators, lionsPanthera leoand spotted hyaenasCrocuta crocuta, at carcasses other than their own kills. Carcasses of different sizes were monitored in two study areas of South Africa: one with both lions and hyaenas and the other with hyaenas only. We found evidence of both symmetric exploitative competition and asymmetric interference competition. Interactions were strongly conditioned by carcass size, and co-occurrence was mostly recorded at large ungulate carcasses. Interference competition seemed to dominate interspecific interactions, with lions having preferential access. However, interference while feeding did not exert any cost on the subordinate hyaenas, in terms of amount of ingested food and consumption rate, probably thanks to the reward provided by large carcasses in the form of abundant carrion, the use of lions to detect carcasses, and spatiotemporal segregation at the carcass-scale. Securing a diverse carrion supply in terms of carcass size, including megaherbivore carcasses, may favor the coexistence of the largest African carnivores, especially in small protected areas.

We used camera traps at baited sites to quantify vigilance behavior of feeding raccoons and used binomial logistic regression to analyze the effects of social and environmental factors. Additionally, we created raccoon and coyote activity patterns from the camera trap data by fitting density functions based on circular statistics and calculating the coefficient of overlap (Delta). Overall, raccoons were vigilant 46% of the time while foraging at baited sites. Raccoons were more vigilant during full moon and diurnal hours but less vigilant as group size increased and when other species were present. Raccoons and coyotes demonstrated nocturnal activity patterns, with coyotes more likely to be active during daylight hours. Overall, raccoons did not appear to exhibit high levels of vigilance. Activity pattern results provided further evidence that raccoons do not appear to fear coyotes, as both species were active at the same time and showed a high degree of overlap (Delta = 0.75) with little evidence of temporal segregation in activity.

Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) are critically endangered and serve as an umbrella species for conservation, but may also affect the activity and distribution of other carnivores.

We detected 39 mammal species including Sumatran tiger and several other threatened mammals. Annual species richness averaged 21.5 (range 19-24) mammals, and remained stable over time. The mammal order significantly affected annual detection of species and the number of cameras where a species was detected, while species conservation status did not. Tigers exhibited a diurnal activity pattern, and had the highest temporal overlap with marbled cats (Pardofelis marmorata), dholes (Cuon alpinus), and Malayan sun bears (Helarctos malayanus), but little overlap with other carnivores.

Camera-trapping surveys were held with 173 systematic camera-trap stations at 10 study sites between November 2007 and July 2016, and reached to 53,995 trap-nights in total. To analyse the camera-trap data, we used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) assuming binomial error distribution for presence/absence data and general linear mixed model (LMM) for the relative abundance data. In both modelling approaches, we considered the study site as the random factor. We estimated the overlap of daily activity patterns of Eurasian lynx with roe deer and brown hare using kernel density estimation.Both GLMM and LMM analyses indicated a significant spatial relationship between the Eurasian lynx and the brown hare (chi(2) = 22.4, P ¡ 0.0001 and Likelihood ratio = 4.8, P ¡ 0.05, respectively), but not between the Eurasian lynx and roe deer (P ¿ 0.05). The daily activity of Eurasian lynx highly overlapped with brown hare (Delta(4) = 0.81), but we found a lower overlap between Eurasian lynx and roe deer (Delta(4) = 0.62). The findings reveal that the presence of Eurasian lynx is temporally and spatially synchronized with the brown hare in northern Anatolia, and support that the brown hare, but not the roe deer, constitutes the main diet of Eurasian lynx in the study area.

Little is known about the foraging strategies of this small subpopulation in Hunchun Nature Reserve on the Chinese side of the border; at this location, the prey base and land use patterns are distinctly different from those in the larger population of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains of Russia. Using dietary analysis of scats and camera-trapping data from Hunchun Nature Reserve, we assessed spatiotemporal overlap of tigers and their prey and identified prey selection patterns to enhance understanding of the ecological requirements of tigers in northeast China. Results indicated that wild prey constituted 94.9% of the total biomass consumed by tigers; domestic livestock represented 5.1% of the diet. Two species, wild boar Sus scrofa and sika deer Cervus nippon, collectively represented 83% of the biomass consumed by tigers. Despite lower spatial overlap of tigers and wild boar compared to tigers and sika deer, tigers preferentially preyed on boar, likely facilitated by high temporal overlap in activity patterns. Tigers exhibit significant spatial overlap with sika deer, likely favoring a high level of tiger predation on this large-sized ungulate. However, tigers did not preferred roe deer Capreolus pygargus and showed a low spatial overlap with roe deer. Overall, our results suggest that tiger prey selection is determined by prey body size and also overlap in tiger and prey use of time or space.

Unfortunately, this information is scarce for elusive species such as the threatened European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), especially in Mediterranean areas. Using radio-tracking and camera-trapping, we studied the habitat selection and the diel activity of a wildcat population in SE Spain, with particular emphasis on the relationships between wildcats and their main prey, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). First, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to analyse the influence of vegetation, rabbit abundance, topography and humanization on wildcat presence at several spatial scales and according to wildcat activity. Second, we used Spearman's rank correlations to assess the spatial relationship between the relative abundance indexes (RAIs) of wildcats and rabbits. Third, we used kernel density estimates to determine the daily activity patterns of wildcats and rabbits, and compared them by calculating the coefficient of overlap Delta. Patch complexity, rabbit abundance, slope and cover of dense scrubs were the most influential variables on wildcat presence. However, the effects of some environmental variables were scale-dependent. The relationship between rabbit abundance and wildcat presence was positive for the smaller scales and, unexpectedly, negative for the largest one. This result was supported by the quadratic relationship between wildcat RAI and rabbit RAI, indicating that wildcats generally avoided the highest rabbit abundance areas. We observed a typical nocturnal activity for wildcats, which surprisingly did not synchronize with the rabbit activity patterns. Rabbit antipredatory strategies, human pressure avoidance behaviour in wildcats and competition with other carnivores could be behind the observed spatiotemporal mismatch between wildcats and rabbits.

Most studies that have examined the effect of season on the diel activity patterns of small mammals have been conducted in temperate climates where daily temperatures and day length are important predictors of activity. Extremely seasonal rainfall in northern Australia possibly exerts a strong influence on mammalian activity due to the influx of food resources. Using camera traps set over a 3-year period, we documented the diel activity patterns of 5 species of small mammals co-occurring on Groote Eylandt, in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. All species were strictly nocturnal but some responded differently to the effect of season. The northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) displayed a bimodal activity pattern that did not differ between the seasons. The northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) displayed bimodal activity in the wet season and unimodal activity in the dry. The more sustained activity of I. macrourus in the dry season may be the result of this species utilizing more cellulose-rich food in times of lower insect abundance, whereas D. hallucatus possibly exhibits lower dietary plasticity. The northern hopping-mouse (Notomys aquilo) was consistently active throughout the night in both seasons. Conversely, the delicate mouse (Pseudomys delicatulus) showed great plasticity in its nocturnal activity which altered significantly depending on both season and habitat. The disparity in activity pattern between these 2 rodents possibly reflects differences in predation risks. The grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) was recorded only during the dry season in coastal grassland habitat, when its activity peaked sharply after nightfall. Our study highlights the interspecific variation in small mammal activity between the wet and dry seasons in northern Australia, which may be explained by differences in diet, habitat use, and predation risk in these species.",2017,"10.1093/jmammal/gyx003","98","english","3",NA,NA,"857",NA,306

We used camera-traps to investigate the temporal and spatial organisation of a mesocarnivore community in a Montado landscape in central Portugal. The target carnivore assemblage was largely dominated by three generalist species - the red fox Vulpes vulpes, the European badger Meles metes and the Egyptian mongoose Herpestes ichneumon - while remaining community members - the common genet Genetta genetta and the feral cat Felis silvestris spp. - exhibited restricted distributions. Interspecific differences in activity rhythms and habitat use were particularly marked among widespread species. Low temporal overlap was reported between the diurnal mongoose and predominantly nocturnal red fox and badger. For the latter two species, contrasting differences in habitat use were associated with anthropogenic-induced environmental heterogeneity. Whereas the red fox used more intensively Montado areas preserving dense shrubby understory and avoided semi-disturbed mosaics of sparse shrubs, the badgers displayed the opposite pattern. Our findings add to previous evidence suggesting that the spatial structure created in highly managed landscapes, particularly the diversity of resulting understory structures, promotes the abundance and spread of generalist mesocarnivore species. These may benefit from the surplus of resource amount (e.g. prey) and the creation of different human-made habitats conditions that provide particular combinations of ecological resources favourable to each species requirements. We concur the common view that maintaining understory heterogeneity in Montado landscapes, menaced by current intensification and extensification trends, is important where carnivore persistence is a relevant conservation goal, but alert for potential effects on carnivore assemblages structuring and impacts for specialist species less tolerant to disturbance.

Some mammals exhibit behavioral plasticity in activity patterns, which allows them to adapt to environmental changes. A good example of this can be found in the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This species is adapted to living in highly humanized environments, where it is often culled because it may affect human interests (e.g. through the consumption of game species or livestock). We assessed the potential main drivers of the daily activity patterns of the red fox in 12 Iberian Mediterranean areas through the use of camera traps. Among drivers, we considered main prey availability (European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), degree of human disturbance (e.g. distance to human settlements, and intensity of predator control) and habitat structure. Our results revealed a predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal activity of foxes with local variations. Although overall fox activity increased with rabbit availability, the temporal overlap with prey activity was on average low, because foxes increased activity when rabbits decreased theirs (twilight-night). Red fox activity rhythms seemed to be determined by human presence where human disturbance is high. In addition, diurnal activity decreased in areas with higher levels of human disturbance (closer to human settlements and high predator control intensity) and increased in dense habitats. Our study shows that daily activity patterns of highly adaptable species are determined by several interacting drivers, resulting in complex behavioral patterns. This suggests that further ecological studies should consider different factors simultaneously for a better understanding of daily activity patterns of wildlife in different landscapes.",2016,"10.1111/jzo.12294","298","english","2",NA,NA,"138",NA,308

Using camera-traps, we studied the species richness, activity patterns, and habitat use of middle and large mammals in two adjacent forests, a native forest and a Eucalyptus grandis reforestation located at the Colombian Central Andes. Since the two forests were adjacent, we expected no differences between species richness in the two forests. The reforestation was a monoculture and an artificial ecosystem, thus we expected differences in activity and habitat use by mammals in the two forest types. We did not find significant differences in the species richness between the forests. The activity of Sciurus granatensis and Mazama rufina was influenced by the time of the day, and there was a temporal and spatial segregation among the soil forager species Nasua nasua, Nasuella olivacea and Dasypus novemcinctus. The species N. nasua and D. novemcinctus used the Andean forest more than the reforestation, whereas N. olivacea used the reforestation more. D. novemcinctus and N. olivacea were mainly nocturnal and/or crepuscular, whereas N. nasua was mainly active during daytime. This suggests that the creation of a new habitat, such as the reforestation, might influence the interactions among some species and apparently, could reduce interspecific competition and thus contribute to their co-existence at the study zone though niche differentiation in time and space.",2016,"10.4404/hystrix-27.2-11319","27","english","2",NA,NA,"104-110",NA,309

During warm periods, mountain ungulates living in open areas typically show a bimodal pattern of activity rhythms, with peaks at dawn and dusk. To date, however, little is known about the activity patterns of mountain ungulates living in forested habitats and in areas where large predators are present. Using camera traps over a 6-month period between May and October of 2012, we investigated the activity pattern of a chamois population dwelling in the forests of the northern Mount Velebit region (Croatia) and its overlap with the activity patterns of potential predators (brown bear, grey wolf) and competitors (wild boar). Chamois showed a peak of activity between 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., when 65 % of individuals were photographed. Contrary to previous literature on chamois, we found evidence for a unimodal pattern of activity with a peak in the early morning hours: At a seasonal level, this pattern remained fairly consistent, though the activity at dusk increased in the warmest months. The main peak of activity occurred during periods of decreased activity of potential predators and competitors, and chamois exhibited the least tolerance for overlap with grey wolf. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this pattern is typical of forest-dwelling populations or if it reflects a temporal niche shift, possibly as a strategy to avoid predators.",2015,"10.1007/s10344-015-0939-z","61","english","5",NA,NA,"794",NA,310

It is considered a vulnerable species, and is one of the least studied felids in the world. In this study our main aim was to document the relationship between the activity pattern of the guina and that of its main prey in the Valdivian rainforest (Comau Fjord, southern Chile) using a camera-trap survey. We documented the activity patterns of small mammals and two ground-foraging bird species, as these have been previously cited as the main prey of this felid. Guinas showed two nocturnal activity peaks, at the beginning and the end of the night, and a weak peak of activity at midday. Small mammals consistently revealed nocturnal activity, whereas both birds were strongly diurnal. Our results revealed a high overlap between the activity patterns of guinas and small mammals, whereas this was negligible for the bird species. These findings support the idea that small mammals are guinas' preferred prey in the Valdivian rainforest. Our study contributes to the understanding of the temporal relationships between the guina and its prey, and may help to design effective management strategies to conserve this vulnerable felid.

Using camera-trapping, we quantifi ed temporal overlap among seven species of Asian wild cats, including tiger Panthera tigris and leopard Panthera pardus. Based on time stamp data from 780 camera-traps and 24 study sites from 14 protected areas across Thailand, we assessed terrestrial activity patterns and temporal overlap in habitat use. For quantifying overlap, we used a coeffi cient estimator (Delta) over cap (1) that allows for calculation of confi dence intervals. Our study provided insight into temporal interactions among species of wild cats, particularly between small cats and their larger cat relatives. We found temporal habitat segregation in several small cats with some species being strongly nocturnal (¿= 85% records between 1800 and 0600 hours - leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis), mostly (¿50%) nocturnal (clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa), mostly diurnal (¿50% records between 0600 and 1800 hours - Asiatic golden cat Catopuma temminckii), or strongly (¿= 85%) diurnal (marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata). We found high temporal overlap ((Delta) over cap ¿= 0.80) between leopard cat and clouded leopard (95% CI = 0.77-0.91), Asiatic golden cat and leopard (95% CI = 0.69-0.87), Asiatic golden cat and tiger (95% CI = 0.72-0.90), and clouded leopard and tiger (95% CI = 0.69-0.85).

Predation risk varies with animal behavior and environmental conditions, yet attempts to understand predation risk in natural systems often ignore important ecological and environmental complexities, relying instead on proxies for actual risk such as predator–prey spatial overlap. Here we detail the ecological and environmental complexities driving disconnects between three stages of the predation sequence that are often assumed to be tightly linked: spatial overlap, encounters and prey capture. Our review highlights several major sources of variability in natural predator–prey systems that lead to the decoupling of spatial overlap estimates from actual encounter rates (e.g. temporal activity patterns, predator and prey movement capacity, resource limitations) and that affect the probability of prey capture given encounter (e.g. predator hunger levels, temporal, topographic and other environmental influences on capture success). Emerging technologies and statistical methods are facilitating a transition to a more spatiotemporally detailed, mechanistic understanding of predator–prey interactions, allowing for the concurrent examination of multiple stages of the predation sequence in mobile, free-ranging animals. We describe crucial applications of this new understanding to fundamental and applied ecology, highlighting opportunities to better integrate ecological contingencies into dynamic predator–prey models and to harness a mechanistic understanding of predator–prey interactions to improve targeting and effectiveness of conservation interventions.",2022,"10.1111/oik.09004","n/a","en","n/a","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.09004","encounter rates and home range overlap and predation risk effects and predation sequence and predator–prey interactions and spatial ecology","e09004",NA,312

We studied the seasonal daily activity patterns and effects of livestock grazing on three large mammals: giant panda, tufted deer, and Chinese serow in Wanglang National Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. The comparison of seasonal daily activity patterns indicated that the giant panda exhibited a single daily peak, whereas tufted deer exhibited two and Chinese serow exhibited multiple peaks. All three large mammals differed significantly in daily activity patterns, while only tufted deer and Chinese serow showed moderate overlap. Livestock grazing (an example of human disturbance) showed high overlap coefficients in daily activity patterns with three mammals, while there was no significant difference between giant pandas and livestock. These results provided a critical baseline mechanism for species coexistence that can help in applied efforts for conservation purposes such as habitat management.

We used camera trap data over a two-year period and quantified the degree of temporal and spatial overlap by comparing activity patterns and calculating Pianka's index respectively. Our results showed that temporal overlap in activity between all carnivore species was high, but complete overlap was possibly reduced by differences in peak activity periods. In addition, low to moderate levels of spatial overlap were found between the different carnivore species, supporting the idea that small carnivore species inhabit different areas than large species to reduce the risk of interference competition.
